<h2>Auto-fill my return</h2>
   <p>"Auto-fill my return" is an online service that allows for parts of a personal tax return to be automatically filled in with information the CRA has available at the time of the request.</p>

<h3>How to use this service</h3>
<p>To use the Auto-fill my return service,</p>
<p>you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be a registered <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/efile-electronic-filers.html">electronic filer</a></li>
<li>be registered in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a> and have a RepID, GroupID, or Business Number (BN)</li>
<li>use an EFILE-certified software</li>
</ul>
<p>your client must:</p>
<ul>
<li>authorize you for online access (RepID, GroupID, or business number) to their CRA tax information, using one of the following methods:<ul>
<li>directly in their My Account.</li>
<li>through your EFILE-certified software. The signature page generated by the software is to be signed by the client and kept by you for six years.&nbsp;</li>
<li>by confirming in their My Account the authorization request you submitted in Represent a Client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Information delivered by the service</h3>
<p>The online service will deliver tax slips and other tax related information that is available at the time of the request.</p>
 <p>Since the CRA receives tax information from third parties, we should have most of your information by mid-March of each year. If information is not available, it is possible that we have not yet received it.</p>
	  <p>If a slip was issued to you with any errors in your personal information, it will <strong>not</strong> be available in your CRA secure portal or with the Auto-fill my return service. In this case, you must contact the issuer for any incorrect slips.</p>

	  <details>
	<summary>Tax information slips</summary>
	<p>The following information may be available for <strong>2016 and subsequent tax years</strong>:</p>

				<summary>If your T5 slip is in more than one name</summary>
			<p>For example, in the case of couples, or a parent and child.</p>
				<p>The Auto-fill my return service gathers all tax income slips that the CRA has available in My Account for you to review in your software. You will be prompted to determine if the amount is accurate and who should report the income from slips showing more than one individual’s name. You will then be able to verify and choose if you wish to report the income in total, in part, or not at all.</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>If you are splitting income from a T5 slip</summary>
				<p>Once the Auto-fill my return service delivers the T5 slip into a NETFILE-certified software, you need to report your share of interest from a joint investment based on how much you contributed to it.</p>
				<p>You can enter the percentage of interest directly in the software. The difference would need to be declared by the other individual.</p>
			</details>
		</li>
		<li>T5007, Statement of Benefits</li>
		<li>T5008, Statement of Securities Transactions
			<details>
				<summary>If you have more than 500 T5008 slips</summary>
				<p>The Auto-fill my return service will not deliver more than 500 T5008 slips.</p>
				<p>If your client has 501 slips or more, they will receive an error message informing them that there were too many slips to deliver. In such a case, all of the T5008 slips will have to be manually entered.</p>
