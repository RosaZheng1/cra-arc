    <h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">Getting an express notice after filing your personal tax return</h1>
<p>If you filed online with certified tax preparation software, you may be able to receive an express notice of assessment (NOA) or notice of reassessment (NOR). </p>
<h2>What is Express NOA</h2>
   <p>Express NOA is a secure CRA service that allows <strong>individuals</strong> and <strong>authorized representatives</strong> to view the NOA or NOR in certified tax preparation software, right after the return has been received and processed by the CRA.</p>  
<p>This service is available to deliver notices year-round in <mark>EFILE and NETFILE</mark> certified tax preparation software.</p>
	  <h3>How it is different from your NOA</h3>
           <p>Your express NOA and your NOA will have the same basic information, however your NOA provides a <strong>complete</strong> detailed summary with the result of your assessed return.</p>
           <details>
                    <summary>Express NOA does not show your payment</summary>
                    <p><mark>If you have to make a payment around the same time that you electronically file your tax return, your payment may not show up on your notice at that time. To confirm any payments made to the CRA, you can check your online banking portal, log into <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a> or call the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html#h6">Individual Tax Account Balance Automated Service</a> to hear your account balance.</mark></p>
           </details>
        <p class="mrgn-tp-lg">Your express NOA is available immediately after your file. Your NOA will be available in your CRA secure portal [when?], or will be sent to you by mail.</p>
  <p>For more information on NOA and NOR, refer to: <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/jmlt333/t1/noa.html">Getting your notice of assessment (NOA)</a></p>
