		   <h3>Using the "Auto-fill my return" service</h3>
<p>When you begin entering your personal information, you will be prompted to enter your My Account user ID and password to use the Auto-fill my return service.</p>
			<details>
			<summary>Entering your My Account userID and password</summary>
			<p>The provincial partners Alberta.ca Account or BC Services Card do <strong>not</strong> work with the Auto-fill my return service.</p>
			<p>If a provincial partner is your only sign-in credential, you will need to register for a CRA credential or a Sign-in partner.</p>
			<p>For more information on registration, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account for individuals</a></p>
		</details>
			
			<p>Once the automated service has populated your return with information, you must make sure that all the proper fields on the return are filled in and that the information provided is true, accurate, and complete.</p>
			
	  <p>Before you file a tax return with the CRA using the information delivered by Auto-fill my return, it is your responsibility to make sure that all proper fields on the return are filled in correctly, including information not delivered by Auto-fill my return. You must make sure that the information provided is true, accurate, and complete before filing. </p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html">contact the CRA</a> if you:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Notice a mistake in the tax-related information</li>
		   <li>Have an account-specific question about other tax-related information</li>
		   <li>Are having problems with the service's login process</li>
		 
		  
	  </ul>
              </li>

	 
				     
            </ol>

<h2>Information delivered by this service</h2>
<p>The Auto-fill my return service will deliver tax information slips and other tax related information that is available at the time of the request.</p>
	  <p>Since the CRA receives tax information from third parties, we should have most of your information by mid-March of each year. If information is not available, it is possible that we have not yet received it.</p>
	  <p>If a slip was issued to you with any errors in your personal information, it will <strong>not</strong> be available in your CRA secure portal or with the Auto-fill my return service. In this case, you must contact the issuer for any incorrect slips.</p>

	  <details>
	<summary>Tax information slips</summary>
	<p>The following information may be available for <strong>2016 and subsequent tax years</strong>:</p>

			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>If you are splitting income from a T5 slip</summary>
