		<p>If your NOA indicates you have a balance owing but you already paid your amount, it may be because your NOA was issued before your payment was received.</p>
		<p>Tax returns that are filed online are generally assessed so quickly that any payments sent with a return may not show up on an NOA.

				  <h4>Summary</h4>
				  <p>This section lists the main lines on your assessed tax return. Next to each line are the amounts we used to calculate your refund or balance owing.</p>
		    <p>Compare these amounts to the ones on your return to see where we made changes, if any.</p>
<p>This section also shows any penalty and interest we calculated on your refund or balance owing. If you have a balance owing from a previous assessment, it will also appear here.</p>

			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <h4>Explanation of changes and other important information</h4>
				 <p>This section explains in detail the changes or corrections we made to your tax return.</p>

</details>
	  <details>
		  <summary>Available contribution room</summary>
	
		    <p>The last line of the statement gives your available contribution room. This is the maximum amount you can contribute for next year.</p>
		      <p>It is your deduction limit minus any unused RRSP contributions you reported in past years. Your unused contributions appear on your statement.</p>
		      <p>If the total RRSP contributions (current and unused) that you claim on your return are less than your deduction limit, you have available contribution room.</p>
		    <details>
			    <summary>Excess contribution</summary>
			    <p>If your RRSP contributions are more than your deduction limit, you have an excess of contributions. You may have to pay tax on this amount.</p>
