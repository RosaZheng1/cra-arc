        <p class="h3"><strong>Contact us right away if your charity has been impacted by wildfires, floods or other adverse weather events</strong></p>
        <p>Disasters, such as floods and wildfires, are occurring more frequently and with greater severity. As always, the safety and security of your directors, employees, volunteers, and communities remain a shared priority.</p>
        <p>In such cases, we understand that you may be unable to meet your filing obligations as usual, due to extraordinary circumstances beyond your control.</p>
        <p>If this situation were to impact your charity, it is important to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/contact-charities-directorate.html">contact the Charities Directorate</a> as soon as possible to discuss your situation.</p>
        <p class="h4"><strong>Keeping adequate books and records</strong></p>
        <p>As a prevention tool, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) recommends that copies of key documents and records be kept at all times in a separate location (preferably off-site) for back-up purposes. This is especially true in the context of protecting your charity’s books and records from damaging adverse weather events. In order to make sure your registered status is not affected, and to help you better understand your books and records obligations as a registered charity, please visit our page on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/checklists-charities/keeping-adequate-books-records.html">Keeping adequate books and records</a>.</p>
        <p class="h4"><strong>We’re here to help</strong></p>
        <p>For more information about your charity’s filing obligations during adverse weather events, please contact the Charities Directorate’s client service team at 1-800-267-2384. Our representatives are available to help you Monday through Friday, from 9 am to 5 pm, local time.</p>

        <p class="h3"><strong>Quarterly updates from the Charities Directorate</strong></p>
        <p>Welcome to our first edition of Quarterly updates from the Charities Directorate! It is so great to have a new way to share information and news with you. We hope these messages provide you and your organization with valuable and relevant information on topics that impact the charitable sector.</p>
        <p>In April, we began our new fiscal year, and I am excited about all that we have planned for 2024-25, including the charity-related items proposed in <a href="https://budget.canada.ca/2024/report-rapport/tm-mf-en.html?utm_source=eml&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Charities_Directorate_Update&amp;utm_content=2024-05-22_0001#a24">Budget 2024</a>. As we continue to modernize and improve our service delivery, we are looking forward to seeing how these budget items will positively impact our operations, as well as those of the charitable sector more broadly.</p>
        <p class="h4"><strong>In case you missed it</strong></p>
        <p>We cannot start a new fiscal year without reflecting on a few highlights from the previous year. Most notably, the Charities Directorate:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li><p>released a new version of <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3010.html">Form T3010, Registered Charity Information Return</a></p></li> 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reminder:</strong> If you are filing an annual information return for a fiscal period ending on or after December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2023, it is important to know that we do not accept outdated versions of Form T3010.

    <p class="h4"><strong>Engaging with the charitable sector</strong></p>
    <p>It has been a busy few months for engagement opportunities!</p>
    <p>In March of 2024, the Charities Directorate had the pleasure of participating in a dialogue with Muslim-led charities, hosted by the <a href="https://islamicstudies.artsci.utoronto.ca">Institute of Islamic Studies at the University of Toronto</a>. We had an opportunity to hear about experiences and issues faced by Muslim-led charities, as well as provide information about the Directorate’s regulatory responsibilities and resources available to the charitable sector to help them comply with their obligations.</p>
    <p>On April&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2024, we attended the <a href="https://advancedseries.cagp-acpdp.org/index.php/en/">Canadian Association of Gift Planners Advanced Canadian Gift Planning Summit</a> for a talk on compliance and the importance of quality data. We also participated in a Fireside Chat with CEO Ruth MacKenzie on a range of regulatory issues of interest to participants.</p>
    <p>On April&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2024, we presented at a virtual event hosted by <a href="https://volunteerottawa.ca/">Volunteer Ottawa</a> to highlight what board members need to know about achieving and maintaining charitable status, including the importance of having board members review their organization’s T3010, Annual Information Return to ensure accuracy.</p>
    <p>The <a href="/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/advisory-committee-charitable-sector.html">Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector</a> (ACCS) also met April&nbsp;11-12,&nbsp;2024. The ACCS includes representatives from both the charitable sector and government. At this meeting, we continued to work together on highlighting and advancing emerging issues related to charities with a view to finalizing their fourth report.</p>
    <p>We spoke at the <a href="https://www.ucbanational.com/">Ukrainian Canadian Bar Association</a>’s Knowledge Hub to share general information about the role of the Charities Directorate, prohibitions on supporting foreign militaries and considerations for charities that provide humanitarian aid abroad on April&nbsp;25,&nbsp;2024.</p>
    <p>On May&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2024, we participated in the <a href="https://www.cba.org/Home">Canadian Bar Association</a>’s Charity Law Symposium. During the symposium, the Charities Directorate provided program updates, such as our latest highlights in education and outreach. We also understand the importance of compliance, and covered some of the Budget 2024 items of interest to the Charities Directorate.</p>
    <p>We look forward to more engagement opportunities in the months ahead.</p>
    <p class="h4"><strong>Spread the news!</strong></p>
    <p>As we begin these quarterly updates, we will need your support in spreading the news. Help us reach more members of the charitable sector, and encourage others to sign up for our <a href="/en/revenue-agency/news/e-services/canada-revenue-electronic-mailing-lists/electronic-mailing-list-charities-giving-whats-new.html">electronic mailing list</a>!

<h4><strong>Transition to Ontario’s Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, 2010</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Are you a registered charity that is incorporated under Ontario’s Corporations Act?</strong></p>
<p>This is a reminder that the Government of Ontario has updated rules for not-for-profit corporations subject to Ontario’s Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, 2010 (ONCA).</p>
<p>If your registered charity is incorporated under Ontario’s Corporations Act, you should review the impact of the new ONCA provisions and determine whether you need to make any changes to your charity’s incorporating and other documents, including your purposes, before the end of the transition period on <strong>October 18, 2024</strong>.</p>
<p>In general, the provisions of ONCA automatically apply to Ontario not-for-profit corporations as of October 19, 2021, subject to the transition provision in s. 207, which provides for a three-year transition period.</p>
<p>If you are considering making changes to your governing document, including your charitable purposes, please <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/contact-charities-directorate.html">contact the Charities Directorate</a> first.</p>

<h4><strong>Fundraising for your charitable work</strong></h4>
<p>Is your charity planning on fundraising in 2024? Visit our website to learn more about the rules for <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/fundraising-activities-charities-other-qualified-donees/fundraising-charitable-work.html">fundraising to support your charitable work</a>. In addition to providing criteria for when fundraising is not acceptable, we also share important information about official donation receipts and directed gifts.</p>
<p>As a general rule, fundraising is any activity that includes a solicitation of present or future donations of cash or non-cash gifts, or the sale of goods or services to raise funds, whether explicit or implied. A charity can use some of its resources for fundraising to support its charitable activities, but it is important to keep in mind that fundraising is not a charitable purpose in itself.</p>

<h4><strong>The CRA is making it easier to access its digital services</strong></h4>
<p><strong>A new way for your authorized representatives to get immediate access to CRA sign-in services is now available.</strong></p>
<p>Have you heard? The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has introduced a new identity validation option, known as the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/cra-user-password-help-faqs/registration-process-access-cra-login-services.html">document verification service</a>, to make it easier for your organization’s <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes/changing-a-charitys-authorized-representative-information.html">authorized representatives</a> to register for digital services including <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>, <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account (MyBA)</a> and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a client</a>. Using a government-issued photo identification (ID), such as a passport or driver’s licence, an authorized representative can quickly validate their identity to get immediate access to their online CRA account.</p>
<p>Currently, the registration process requires individuals to request a CRA security code by mail, which can take up to 10 business days. With the new identity validation option, authorized representatives are able to get immediate access to their account without having to wait for their code in the mail. There is still, however, the option to request a CRA security code by mail.</p>
<p>The CRA’s digital services allow charities to easily file their annual information return, update their personal information, and check the status of requests submitted to the CRA. These services can help provide access to important information, and speed up the filing process. By giving charities self-serve options to manage their affairs online, they can avoid having to call or potential delays as their annual filing deadline approaches.</p>
<p>To use this new identity validation option, the user must be 16 years of age or older and have a camera-enabled mobile device that will allow them to take a photo of their government-issued ID. Only the following pieces of identification are currently being accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canadian passport</li>
<li>Canadian driver’s licence</li>
<li>Provincial/Territorial ID card</li>
</ul>
<p>When registering for digital services, authorized representatives will also need to provide their social insurance number (SIN), date of birth, and information from their most recently assessed tax return from either the current or previous year.</p>
<p>The protection of personal information is a priority for the CRA and we want to assure Canadians that this new identity validation option is safe and secure.</p>

<h4><strong>Canadian registered charities carrying on activities outside Canada</strong></h4>
<p>Does your registered charity carry on activities outside Canada, including in areas of conflict or humanitarian crises? If so, it’s important to understand how Canadian rules and regulations apply to your charitable work. No matter where you operate, as a Canadian registered charity your purposes and activities&nbsp;must always comply with Canadian law, including the requirements for registered charities under the Income Tax Act and common law.</p>
<p>The Income Tax Act allows a registered charity to operate, both inside and outside Canada, by:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>carrying on its own charitable activities through:&nbsp;<ul>
<li>its staff and volunteers&nbsp;</li>
<li>an <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/policies-guidance/guidance-002-canadian-registered-charities-carrying-activities-outside-canada.html">intermediary</a>, where a charity must exercise direction and control&nbsp;over its own resources</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>making qualifying disbursements through:&nbsp;<ul>
<li>gifts to qualified donees&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/policies-guidance/charities-making-grants-non-qualified-donees.html">grants to grantees (non-qualified donees)</a>, where a charity must meet accountability requirements&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about topics such as making sure your resources are devoted to charitable activities, working with intermediaries, and proper record keeping and reporting practices, refer to our <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/policies-guidance/guidance-002-canadian-registered-charities-carrying-activities-outside-canada.html">guidance product CG-002, Canadian registered charities carrying on activities outside Canada</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting suspected non-compliance by registered charities</strong></p>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is responsible for protecting the integrity of the tax system and maintaining trust in the charitable sector. If you have information that a charity may not be complying with the Income Tax Act, you can report it to the CRA by submitting a lead to the Leads Program. The CRA reviews all leads to determine whether non-compliance has occurred.

<p>Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is proud to announce the<strong> launch of the National Call for Proposals (CFP) 2024 for the Settlement and Resettlement Programs</strong>. IRCC is committed to ensuring newcomers and refugees have the support and services they need to make the most of their talents and experience in order to fully integrate and contribute to the Canadian economy and their communities.

<h4><strong>GST/HST rebate for charities</strong></h4>
<p>Did you know that registered charities and registered Canadian amateur athletic associations are able to claim a rebate of some of the goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) they pay?</p>
<p>Thanks to the public service bodies’ (PSB) rebate, your charity may be eligible to recover 50% of the GST and federal portion of the HST paid or payable for eligible purchases and expenses related to your organization’s activities. Charities in participating provinces are also entitled to a rebate of their portion of the HST.</p>
<p>For more information on how your charity can claim a PSB rebate, read our article <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/news114/news114-excise-gst-hst-news-no-114.html#_Toc140843028">Are you a registered charity that paid GST/HST on your purchases and want some of that GST/HST back?</a></p>
<p>For the complete guide, including deadlines to file rebate claims, visit <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4034/rc4034-gst-hst-public-service-bodies-rebate.html">RC4034 – GST/HST Public Service Bodies' Rebate</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>New trust reporting requirement for tax years ending on or after December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2023</strong></h4>
<p>On December&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2022, Bill C-32, the Fall Economic Statement Implementation Act, 2022, received Royal Assent. This bill amended the Income Tax Act to expand the filing requirements for trusts.</p>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) understands that registered charities are seeking clarification on how these new requirements apply to internal trusts.</p>
<p>The CRA will <strong>not</strong> require registered charities to file the T3, Trust Income Tax and Information Return, for internal trusts.</p>
<p>Internal trusts are those created when a charity:</p>
<ul>
<li>receives property as a gift that is subject to certain legally enforceable terms and conditions; and,</li>
<li>holds that property as the trustee of the trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registered charities report on their finances and activities annually by filing the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/t3010-charity-return-before-you-file.html">T3010, Registered Charity Information Return</a>. These returns include aggregate information about all the property a charity holds, including internal trusts. Registered charities should ensure these annual returns are complete and accurate, as they serve important public information and compliance purposes.</p>
<p><strong>We’re here to help</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions on the new requirements, please call our Charities Directorate client service team at 1-800-267-2384. Our representatives are available to help you Monday through Friday, from 9&nbsp;am to 5&nbsp;pm, local time.</p>
<h3><strong>2023-11-09</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>A new version of the Form T3010 is coming in January 2024&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>In 2022, the Government of Canada announced measures to boost charitable spending in our communities and passed legislation changing disbursement quota rules for registered charities.</p>
<p>In January 2024, the Canada Revenue Agency will release a new version of the Form T3010, Registered Charity Information Return, to reflect new reporting requirements. At that time, there will be two downloadable versions of the Form T3010:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charities with fiscal periods ending <strong>on or before December 30, 2023,</strong> should file their Form T3010 using <strong>version 23</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Charities with fiscal periods ending <strong>on or after December 31, 2023,</strong> will have to file their Form T3010 using <strong>version 24</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to always download the Form T3010 from the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3010.html">T3010 Registered Charity Information Return page</a> when you start preparing your annual information return. This will ensure you are using the correct version. If you send us an outdated version of the form, we will not accept it for filing.</p>
<p>We encourage all charities to file online using <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a> (MyBA) or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a>. The online form automatically presents you with the correct version of the annual information return, depending on what fiscal period you are filing for. For more information on how to sign up for MyBA, visit our page <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/toolbox-directors-officers-volunteers/business-account.html">Access our online services for charities</a>.&nbsp;</p>
