      <summary>What residential ties are</summary>
      <p>The most important factor to determine your residency status in Canada is whether or not you have established and maintain significant residential ties with Canada.</p>
      <p>Significant residential ties to Canada include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a home you own or lease in Canada</li>
        <li>a spouse (someone you are legally married to) or common-law partner (someone you live with in a marriage-like relationship, but are not married to) in Canada</li>
        <li>dependants in Canada</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Secondary residential ties that may be relevant include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>personal property in Canada, such as a car or furniture</li>
        <li>social ties in Canada, such as memberships in Canadian recreational organizations or ethnocultural groups</li>

    <h3 id="h-0b">Immigration status</h3>
    <p>Your immigration status tells you if you can live, work, or study in Canada. It reflects your reasons for being in Canada and the length of your stay, but it does not tell you about your tax filing obligations like your residency status does. For all benefit and credit payments, you need to be a resident of Canada for income tax purposes. </p>
    <p>For some benefit and credit payments, you also need to have a valid immigration status. As a newcomer to Canada, your immigration status could be: </p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Permanent Resident</dt>
      <dd> Individuals who have been given permanent resident status, including permanent resident card holders or those who have received confirmation of permanent residence (document IMM5292 or IMM5688) from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).</dd>
      <dt>Protected <span clas="nowrap">persons</span> (refugees)</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Individuals who have been granted protected person status by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) or the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB).</li>
          <li>Individuals who have been granted protected person status by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) or the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB). </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Temporary Resident </dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Individuals who hold permits such as study permits, work permits, visitor records, and temporary resident permits</li>
          <li>Individuals who maintain temporary resident status by applying to extend their permit before it expires. </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>For some benefit and credit payments, such as the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview.html">Canada  Child Benefit</a>, the CRA needs to know your immigration status and the date you arrived in Canada to determine if you qualify and when you can start receiving payments. For example, a temporary resident who has lived in Canada for the previous 18 months, and who has a valid permit in the 19th month.</p>

    <h2 id="h-50">Canada’s tax system</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Canada's tax system is similar to that of many countries.  Employers and other payers usually deduct taxes from the income they pay you,  whereas individuals with business or rental income usually pay their taxes  by instalment.</p>
        <p>Many of the benefits people enjoy in Canada are made possible  through taxes. Canada's tax system pays for roads, schools, health care, social  security and public safety.</p>
        <p>Each year, you determine your tax obligation by completing an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package.html">Income Tax  and Benefit Return</a> and sending it to the CRA. On the return,  you:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>report your income and claim your       deductions</li>
          <li>calculate your federal and provincial or       territorial tax</li>
          <li>determine if you have a balance or a       refund of all or part of the tax that was deducted from your income during       the year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4055/t4055-newcomers-canada.html#P90_5779">who has to file a return</a>. </p>
        <p>Under Canada's tax system, you have the right and responsibility  to determine your income tax status and make sure you pay your required amount  of tax each year according to the law.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/long-should-you-keep-your-income-tax-records.html">Keep all  receipts and documents for at least six years </a>after  you file your return. If the CRA chooses to review your return, you  will have to provide your receipts to support your claims.</p>

              <li>earning extra income on the side of your full-time work         (for example, by renting out a room or providing a ride-sharing service)</li>

    <p>You can apply to start getting benefit and credit payments even before you file your first tax return.</p>
    <details>
      <summary>How that timeframe works</summary>
      <p> As a newcomer to Canada, you are not required to file a tax return until the following year after you become a resident for tax purposes. For example, if you arrived in June 2023, you will not be required to file a 2023 income tax return until April 30, 2024. </p>
      <p>When applying for benefit and credit payments, the CRA may ask for information on your marital status, date of entry into Canada, immigration status, proof of birth for your children, and income information for you and your spouse or common-law partner from all sources for up to two years before arriving in Canada. </p>
      <p>This information is used to calculate your benefit and credit payment amounts so you can start receiving payments as soon as you are a resident of Canada, even before filing a tax return.</p>
      <p>If any of your documents are in a language other than English of French, you’ll need to provide copies of the original documents along with an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/review-your-tax-return-cra/common-adjustments.html#toc4">acceptable translation</a>. </p>
      <p>If you earned money outside of Canada before you became a resident, you won’t have to pay Canadian taxes on that income.</p>
    </details>
    <p>You <strong>don't</strong> need to do your first tax return before you can get these 3 payments the <strong>first year</strong> you arrive in Canada.</p>

    <p>In most cases, the CRA automatically considers you for benefit and credit payments when you do your taxes. However, you may need to apply and be approved for some benefits and credits. </p>
    <p>Even if you do not owe tax, are tax-exempt, or have no income to report, you should do your taxes every year to avoid missing out on benefit and credit payments and tax refunds. The information from your tax return is used to calculate payments.</p>
    <p>In Canada, the tax year follows the calendar year, running from January 1 to December 31. </p>
    <p>You and your spouse or common-law partner, if applicable, have until April 30 each year to do your taxes. If you or your spouse or common-law partner are self-employed, the deadline to do your taxes is June 15. </p>
    <p>If you live in Quebec, you also need to file a provincial tax return each year <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/">Revenu Québec</a>.</p>
