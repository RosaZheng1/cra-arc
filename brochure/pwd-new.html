<h2 id="h-1">Do your taxes to get payments</h2>
    <p>In most cases, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) automatically considers you for benefit and credit payments when you do your taxes. However, you may need to apply and be approved for some benefits and credits. </p>
    <p>Even if you do not owe tax, are tax-exempt, or have no income to report, you should do your taxes every year to avoid missing out on benefit and credit payments and tax refunds. The information from your tax return is used to calculate payments.</p>
    <p>You and your spouse or partner, if applicable, have until April 30 each year to do your taxes. If you or your spouse are self-employed, the deadline to do your taxes is June 15. </p>
    <p>If you live in Quebec, you also need to file a provincial tax return each year with <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/">Revenu Québec</a>.</p>
    <p>Find out <a href"https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/important-dates-individuals.html">when you must file a tax return</a> and how to get <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/income-tax/personal-income-tax/get-ready-taxes.html">ready to do your taxes</a>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Disability       Supports Deduction:</strong> Budget 2024 announces the government’s intention to amend the Income Tax Act to make additional expenses eligible for the Disability Supports Deduction, subject to certain conditions, such as: 
        <ul >
          <li>so	service animals trained to perform specific tasks for people with certain severe impairments; </li>
          <li>o	alternative computer input devices, such as assistive keyboards, braille display, digital pens, and speech recognition devices; and, </li>
          <li>o	ergonomic work chairs and bed positioning devices, including related assessments</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Home Buyers' Plan :</strong> Budget 2024 proposes to increase the Home Buyers' Plan withdrawal limit from $35,000 to $60,000. An individual can use the withdrawn funds to buy or build a qualifying home for themselves or for a related person with a disability. The newly increased limit would be available to first-time buyers after April 16, 2024.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Budget 2024 also provides funding for a new  <strong>Canada Disability Benefit</strong>. The proposed benefit is intended to support low-income persons with disabilities between the ages of 18 and 64 who have a valid Disability Tax Credit certificate. More information will be posted on Employment and Social Development Canada’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/disabilities-benefits.html">overview of the Canada Disability Benefit</a> page in the future as it becomes available. </p>
