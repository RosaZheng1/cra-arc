    <h2 id="h-1">Changes to the disability supports deduction</h2>
    <h3>Current situation</h3>
    <p>Individuals who have an impairment in physical or mental functions and have paid for certain medical expenses may, under certain conditions, be able to deduct the expenses they paid during the year so they could:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>work</li>
      <li>go to school</li>
      <li>do research for which they received a grant</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mrgn-tp-md">Only the person with the disability can claim expenses for this deduction.</p>
    <p>For a list of expenses that are currently recognized under the disability supports deduction and any certification that may be needed from a medical practitioner, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-21500-disability-supports-deduction.html">Line 21500 – Disability supports deduction - Canada.ca</a>.</p>
    <h3>What are the proposed changes</h3>
    <p>Budget 2024 proposes to expand the list of expenses recognized under the disability supports deduction for an individual who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#id-3">has a severe and prolonged impairment in physical function</a></li>
      <li><a href="#id-4">has an impairment in physical or mental functions</a></li>
      <li><a href="#id-5">has a vision impairment</a></li>
      <li><a href="#id-6">is blind or profoundly deaf or has severe autism, severe diabetes, severe epilepsy, severe mental impairment or a severe and prolonged impairment that markedly restricts the use of the individual’s arms or legs</a></li>
