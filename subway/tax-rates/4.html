          <p>On <span class="nowrap">December 9, 2019</span>, the Government announced an increase to the basic personal amount. For individuals whose net income for the year is less than or equal to the amount at which the 29% tax bracket begins ($150,473 for 2020), the basic personal amount increased to $13,229 for 2020, $13,808 for 2021, $14,398 for 2022, $15,000 for 2023. The amount is indexed after 2023. For individuals whose net income is greater than the amount at which the 29% tax bracket begins ($150,473 for 2020), the increase in the basic personal amount gradually phases out so that the basic personal amount for individuals whose income is greater than the next tax bracket threshold ($214,368 for 2020), remains unchanged ($12,298 for 2020) and continues to be indexed.</p>
          <p>Similar increases were announced for the maximum spouse or common-law partner amount and the maximum amount for an eligible dependant. The phase out of the increase is based on the individual’s income rather than the income of the dependant.</p>

          <p> The 2019 Federal Budget announced the Canada training credit (CTC) which started in 2020. Individuals can accumulate $250 towards their Canada training credit limit each year if, in the preceding year, they met all eligibility conditions. An individual’s Canada training credit limit for a year represents the maximum credit they can claim in that year, and will be reduced in the subsequent year by the amount of any CTC claimed. Eligibility conditions include a minimum working income threshold and a maximum net income threshold in respect of the preceding year. For example, the accumulation of a $250 Canada training credit limit for 2020 was dependent on income in 2019; for 2020 the minimum working income threshold of $10,000 and the maximum net income threshold (the amount at which the 29% tax bracket begins for the 2019 year – $147,667) was applied to a taxpayer’s income earned in 2019. </p>
