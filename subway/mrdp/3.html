  <ul>
    <li>The seller is a resident of another jurisdiction
    <li>The seller has real or immovable property in which they’re renting in the partner jurisdiction </li>

  <p>For more information about the reportable elements,  refer to:  Chapter 6 of the

  </p>
  <h3>Expect your platform operator(s) to ask for your information</h3>
  <p>As a result of these rules, platform operators on which you are selling may ask you for additional information about you or your business in order to fulfill their reporting obligations to the CRA. </p>
  <h3>Watch out for scams and fraud</h3>
  <p>Only share your information with trusted sources for your tax reporting purposes. To learn the signs of scams or fraud, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/security/protect-yourself-against-fraud.html">Scam prevention and the CRA</a></p>
  </ul>
  <h3>Consequences for not providing the required  information </h3>
  <p>If you do not provide your TIN to your platform operator(s), the CRA may assess you a penalty of $500 for each failure to provide your TIN. </p>
  <h3>Other tax obligations</h3>
  <p>For more information about your tax obligations as an  online seller, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/platform-economy.html">Taxes  and the platform economy</a></p>

  <p>A reporting platform operator <strong>does not have to report the required information concerning a seller</strong> to the CRA if they have obtained adequate assurances that another platform operator has or will fulfil their reporting obligations according to the rules in Canada or under substantially similar rules in a partner jurisdiction where the reportable seller is not resident in Canada . </p>

    </ul>
  <h3>Due diligence procedures</h3>
  <p>As a reporting platform operator, you must take steps to verify the reliability of the information you collect and report under the rules. </p>
  <p>More specifically, you must verify the reliability of: </p>
  <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Information collected in respect of entities that are <a href="2.html#excluded-seller-inner">excluded seller</a></li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Seller information</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The address of each property listing, if applicable </li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="far fa-calendar-alt fa-lg text-muted"></span> These  steps must be completed by <strong>December 31</strong> of the reportable period to which they  relate, except for transitional periods (i.e. the first year a platform  operator is considered a reporting platform operator under the rules). </p>
  <p>For more information about due diligence procedures, refer to:
    <mark> Chapter 5 of the <a href="#">Guidance on the Reporting Rules for Digital Platform Operators</a></mark>
