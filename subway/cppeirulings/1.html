  </ul>
  <h2 id="h-1">If the individual is an employee</h2>
  <p>Employees have certain entitlements, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/services/pensions/cpp/index.shtml"><abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> benefits</a></li>
    <li>and <a href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/ei/index.shtml"><abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr></a> benefits</li>
    <li>protection under <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/jobs/workplace/federal-labour-standards.html">employment standards</a></li>
    <li>health and safety and workers’ compensation laws</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Under <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> and <abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr> legislation, both the employer and the employee may be obligated to contribute to the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> when the employee is in pensionable employment and to <abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr> when the employee is in insurable employment. Employers make <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions and pay <abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr> premiums for each employee and deduct <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-deductions-contributions/canada-pension-plan-cpp.html"><abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-deductions-contributions/employment-insurance-ei.html"><abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI </abbr>premiums</a> from amounts they pay their employees and remit these amounts to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-md">
    <li class="cnjnctn-col">
      <p>For <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions, the employer and employee portions are the same. </p>
    </li>
    <li class="cnjnctn-col">
      <p>For <abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr> premiums, the employer portion is generally 1.4 times the employee portion.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>An employer who fails to deduct the required CPP contributions or EI premiums has to pay both the employer's share and the employee's share of any contributions and premiums owing, plus penalties and interest. For more employer information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll.html">Payroll</a>.</p>
  <h3>If an employee of a corporation controls more than 40% of the voting shares</h3>
  <p>Employees may be entitled to deduct certain employment expenses, including motor vehicle expenses. All legislative requirements must be met, including having the employer fill out and sign Form T2200, Declaration of Conditions of Employment. For more information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4044.html">Guide T4044, Employment Expenses</a>.</p>
  <h3> If the employment is in Quebec </h3>
  <p>When the employment is in Quebec, the employer and the employee may be obligated to contribute to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/businesses/source-deductions-contributions/calculating-source-deductions-and-employer-contributions/quebec-pension-plan-contributions/">Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)</a>; and</li>
    <li>the <a href="https://www.rqap.gouv.qc.ca/en/wage-earner/eligibility-conditions">Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP)</a> for access to maternity, paternity, parental, and adoption benefits</li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Employees are covered by employment labour legislation </h3>
  <p>Most businesses or industries have to follow employment standards under provincial or territorial employment standards legislation; however, some businesses or industries are <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/employment-equity/regulated-industries.html">federally regulated</a>, in which case the employment standards that regulate an employee’s conditions of work are defined by the Canada Labour Code.</p>
  <p>Federal and provincial/territorial employment standards cover minimum wage, vacation pay, holiday pay, and overtime pay. For more information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/jobs/workplace/federal-labour-standards.html">Federal Labour Standards</a> or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/employment-equity/regulated-industries.html">Provincial and Territorial Ministries of Labour</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="h-2">If the individual is <span class="nowrap">self-employed</span></h2>
  <p>A self-employed worker may operate a business on their own as a sole proprietorship or with others under a partnership.</p>
  <p>All self-employed workers pay both the employer and employee portions of <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions when they file their <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package.html">T1 income tax and benefit return</a> using Schedule 8, CPP Contributions on Self-Employment and Other Earnings.</p>
  <p>Self-employed workers do not pay <abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr> premiums unless they opt into the <abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr> program for access to <a href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/ei/sew/index.shtml">employment insurance special benefits</a>, which include maternity, parental, sickness, compassionate care, and family caregiver benefits. If they want to opt in, they have to register with the <abbr title="Canada Employment Insurance Commission ">CEIC</abbr>.</p>
  <p>When self-employed workers opt into the <abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr> program to access <abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr> special benefits, they pay the same <abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr> premium rate as employees pay. These <abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr> premiums are paid when the self-employed worker files their <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package.html">T1 income tax and benefit return</a> using Schedule 13, Employment Insurance Premiums on Self-Employment and Other Eligible Earnings. Unlike with the regular <abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr> program, self-employed workers do<strong> not </strong>have to pay the employer’s portion of <abbr title="Employment Insurance ">EI</abbr> premiums.</p>
  <p>Self-employed workers may be entitled to deduct certain expenses. For more information on these expenses, go to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/sole-proprietorships-partnerships/business-expenses.html">Business expenses</a>.</p>
