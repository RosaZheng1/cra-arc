  <p>Applies to contracts formed in Quebec.</p>
  <p>When the CRA examines whether a person is an employee or a self-employed individual in the province of Quebec, the CRA examines the relationship between the worker and the payer, using a three-step approach.</p>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr">
    <li>
      <h3>
        <mark>[Need heading here]</mark>
      </h3>
      <p>The CRA asks the worker and the payer what their intent was when they  entered into the working arrangement. Did the two parties intend to enter into  a&nbsp;<strong>contract of service&nbsp;</strong>(employer‑employee relationship) or did  they intend to enter into a&nbsp;<strong>contract for services&nbsp;</strong>(business  relationship)?</p>
      <p>The CRA needs to know how they defined their working relationship and  why they defined it as such.</p>
      <p>Sometimes the intention is clear and both parties are in agreement  (common intent). Sometimes the intent can be found in a written agreement.  Sometimes the two parties have a different understanding of the status of their  employment relationship, in which case there is no common intent.</p>
      <p>To decide the parties' intentions, the CRA gets a copy of the contract,  or testimony by the parties and examines the parties' actions. Both parties'  intentions form part of the context of the employment that the CRA analyses.</p>
      <p>Workers and payers can choose how they set up their affairs; however,  the employment status they choose must reflect their working relationship. In  other words, all of the facts, including the actual terms and conditions of  employment, determine a worker's employment status, not just the intention.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>
        <mark>[Need heading here]</mark>
      </h3>
      <p>The CRA looks to see if the employment meets the definition of a  contract of employment or of a business contract (contract for services)  defined in the Civil Code of Québec by considering the following factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>carrying out the work</li>
        <li>remuneration</li>
        <li>relationship of       subordination</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is important to gather the facts and analyze them in light of the  specific context of the employment and the intent of the parties.</p>
