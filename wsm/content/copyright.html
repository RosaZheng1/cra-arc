	  <h2 id="h-1">Understand what copyright is</h2>
      <p>Content providers either create their own content or provide content written by another public servants and host it on a goverment site. Sometimes this content includes additional information from a third party, and risks copyright infringement. </p>
      <p>Copyright is the exclusive legal right to produce, reproduce, publish or perform an original literary, artistic, dramatic or musical work in any form. Copyright typically exists in and protects the following: books, pamphlets, articles, cartoons, product manuals, computer programs, films, plays, scripts, musical compositions, songs, paintings, sculptures, photographs, architectural plans, <abbr title="and so forth">etc</abbr>. <strong>This list is not exhaustive.</strong> </p>
      <p>The creator of the work is usually the copyright owner. <strong>However, an employer owns the copyright in material created by its employees when the work is made in the course of employment</strong>, unless there is an agreement in place stating otherwise. Copyright in work created by employees of the Government of Canada is typically owned by the Government, unless there is a written agreement stating otherwise.</p>
      <p>Copyright attaches automatically upon the creation of an original work in tangible form without the need for marking with a copyright notice. However, copyright owners often mark their work with a copyright notice which has the symbol &copy; or the word “Copyright”, the name of the copyright owner and the year of first publication. Also, the following words are often added to a copyright notice “All rights reserved”. While the use of a copyright notice is not required under Canadian law, it is often used to signal to people that the work is protected by copyright. <strong>Copyrighted work is protected with or without copyright notices</strong>. (For example, a photographic image obtained off the internet)</p>
      <p>The copyright owner has the right to control how their work is used. Others who want to use the work must obtain the right to do so: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>usually with a contract </li>
        <li>a license agreement </li>
        <li>a subscription </li>
        <li>or written permission from the copyright owner</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>No Copyright in ideas</h3>
      <p><strong>Copyright protection does not extend to facts, ideas, or information</strong>. Copyright protects the particular way that an author expresses the ideas, facts or information. In other words copyright protects an author’s manner of expression. For example, a history textbook on Canadian confederation is protected by copyright, but the facts on which the book may be based, such as the date of confederation, the creation of the British North America Act, are not. </p>
      <h2 id="h-2">Impacts of copyright infringement</h2>
      <p><strong>Copyright infringement violates Canadian copyright laws</strong>. It can expose the Agency to legal action. Damages can be in the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars <strong>per infraction</strong>, depending on the infringement. Additional costs can include the legal fees and time spent preparing for and defending the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The reputation of the  Government of Canada risk being damaged when they are the subject of a legal action. Copyright lawsuits are public and can be reported in the news and on social media.</p>
      <h2 id="h-3">Obtaining copyright permission</h2>
      <p>If you purchase or otherwise obtain the right to use a copyrighted work either through a license, a subscription, online terms of use or other form of contract, then you must look to the terms of the applicable agreement to determine if your proposed use of the copyrighted work is permitted. The terms of the applicable agreement set out the permitted uses and restrictions on use in respect of the copyrighted work. These terms <strong>must be</strong> adhered to. </p>
      
        <p>If you are not aware of the document or the terms that set out the user rights, <strong>assume the material is copyright protected</strong>. Permission to use will have to be obtained from the copyright owner. </p>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="lst-stps">
	<li><h4>Plan ahead</h4>
	<p>Obtaining permission may take a long time, so you should factor that into your publishing plan. <strong>Do not assume</strong> that you will get permission from the content creator. They may refuse.</p></li>
      <li><h4>Contact the owner</h4><p>Email or write to the owner of the material and request permission to use. Ensure that your request contains sufficient information and details to enable the recipient to understand the permission that is being sought. The request should at a minimum include the following information: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Explain clearly what work </strong>you want to use and how you wish to use it </li>
        <li><strong>Identify the work </strong>that you wish to use
          <ul>
            <li>Be specific </li>
            <li>For example, it is not enough to ask the copyright owner to use &quot;all&quot; of the images on their site or to make copies of &quot;some&quot; of their manuals </li>
            <li>In the example of a manual, identify the manual name, the product name, product version, manual version and anything else that will enable the reader of the request to understand what is being asked </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Specify the proposed use of the work</strong>, for example:
          <ul>
            <li>Do you wish to distribute the material
              <ul>
                <li>If so, how will the material be distributed </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Will copies be made to hand out copies at a conference
              <ul>
                <li>If so, how many copies will be distributed </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Will the material post online (internal intranet site)</li>
            <li>If material is posted online, did you identify the number of individuals that have access to it</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <details><summary>Example: Request to post a copyright document</summary>
        
        <p>I am writing in respect of the article titled xxxxx that was in volume 3 February 2016, of the publication titled xxxx. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is seeking permission to post this article on the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> internal intranet website which may be viewed by approximately 43,000 <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> employees. </p>
       </details>
	    <details><summary>Example: Request to use an image</summary>
        <p>I would like to include this photo in a slide presentation at a Canada Revenue Agency conference for 500 employees. Hard copies of the presentation will also be distributed to those in attendance. </p>
      </details>
	   <p>In the case of materials created by a commercial entity you may need to send the request to a public relations office, legal department, or general contact email address.</p>
	   <details><summary>Example: Request letter</summary>
      <div class="well mrgn-bttm-0">
        <p> To whom it may concern:</p>
        <p> In order to respect your copyright, I am writing to request permission to post copies of the entire user manual and images for &quot;Product X&quot; on our corporate intranet which could be viewed by approximately 40,000 employees. We have written a product evaluation for &quot;Product X&quot; and would like to include your official photos and the user manual of the product to provide our users with additional information. Unfortunately we cannot just provide a link to your website for this information, since many of our users don’t have the ability to access third-party websites from their work computer.</p>
        <p> Please respond to this email to let us know if this permission is granted. If you would like to discuss this request further please email me at <span class="nowrap">xxxxxx@cra-arc.gc.ca</span> or call me at xxx-xxx-xxxx.</p>
        <p>Yours truly,</p>

	  </li>
      <li><h4>If rights are granted</h4><p>If the copyright owner grants permission to use copyrighted materials, use the materials <strong>only</strong> as per the terms of the permission.</p>
<p>	  <strong>Do not</strong> use the materials in any other way unless you obtain additional permission for that specific ‘new’ use. For example, if the content owner has given you permission to post materials on the internet, if you want to reproduce the materials to be included in a handout at a conference, you must again ask for permission.</p>
     
      <p><strong>Do not rely on permission provided verbally. Written permission </strong> must <strong>be obtained</strong> to ensure there is a record of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who gave permission </li>
        <li>How to contact the person that gave permission </li>
        <li>What was permitted </li>
        <li>When was permission provided </li>
      </ul>
      
        <p><strong>An email is sufficient for legal purposes</strong>. As well, and very importantly, if permission is obtained the responsible program area must track usage to ensure that use of the materials is in fact in accordance with the permission that was obtained. </p>

      <h2 id="h-4">Scope of copyright</h2>
	  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
	  <dt>Your own work</dt>
	  <dd>
        It is your decision if you want to copy and distribute your own work. You may authorize people to use your work freely or in a restricted way. Remember that copyright for content you create for your employer in the course of your employment does not belong to you. It belongs to your employer, unless you have an agreement that states otherwise.</dd>
      <dt>A non substantial portion of the work</dt>
       <dd><p>A non substantial portion of a work may include quoting a few sentences from an article or book, or a few words from a short poem or song. The source and the creator must be indicated along with the quote. </p>
      <p>If quoting more than a few sentences at a time, consider whether the amount copied is large in relation to the size of the source. For example, quoting several sentences from a small news article could be considered substantial. </p>
      <p>As well, the question of what is a substantial portion of a work takes into consideration more than just quantity. It is important to also consider the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the quality of material copied </li>
        <li>the importance of the parts to the author's work </li>
        <li>the purpose for which the material was copied </li>
        <li>whether the work was copied to save time and effort </li>
        <li>whether the material is used in the same or a similar fashion as the author's </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The analysis of whether a portion of copyrighted work is substantial or non substantial requires a complex legal analysis<strong>. If in doubt seek legal input from </strong> the legal department, <strong>or ask permission from the copyright owner. </strong></p></dd>
      <dt>Works in which copyright has expired</dt>
	  <dd>
        In Canada copyright exists for the life of the author (the remainder of the calendar year in which the author dies) and a period of fifty years following the end of that calendar year. Other rules apply to determine the period of copyright when the author is unknown, or when there are joint authors. Material for which copyright has expired may be copied without restriction. This is the reason that there are so many different publications of literary classics, for example, those written by Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters. </p>
      <dt>Creative commons licenses or other open use licenses</dt>
	  <dd><p>Creative commons or other open use licenses offer creators a spectrum of licensing choices. These range from: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>allowing downloading and sharing the work for non-commercial purposes, provided no changes are made to the shared work </li>
        <li>allowing sharing work that is changed for non-commercial purposes only </li>
        <li>allowing sharing work that is changed for commercial purposes </li>
        <li>charging license fees for commercial use </li>
        <li>charging for 'extras' such as for a physical printed version </li>
      </ul>
      
        <p><strong>Use care when reproducing materials</strong> with a Creative Commons or other open use type of license. Read the terms of the license carefully. Always ensure your use is permitted under the applicable license terms. The terms and conditions of each license are different. Different Creative Commons licenses permit different uses at the option of the creator. For example, the creator might permit sharing of their work provided you do not change it. As well, if you copy, the Creative Commons licenses requires that you use the same licensing terms, identification of the creator, a copyright notice, as well as a notice that refers to the disclaimer of all warranties and limitation of liability. </p>

        <abbr title="Government of Canada">GoC</abbr> material can be reproduced for personal or public non-commercial purposes unless there is language or terms that say you can't. Check the &quot;Terms and conditions&quot; section of the Government agency's website to make sure.</p>
      <p><strong>Note: </strong>if you want to revise, adapt, or translate a <abbr title="Government of Canada">GoC</abbr> work you must get permission.</p></dd>
      <dt>Hyperlinks to third party content</dt>
	  <dd>
        <p>In general, the use of external hyperlinks are permitted. However, if access to the hyperlinked site is through a subscription, or if a technological protection measure controls access to the site or work, then permitted use of the material will be in accordance with the subscription or other agreement terms. </p>
      
        <p>Content posted on the internet is copyright protected unless there is some clear notice that states otherwise. For example, the National Post website contains a copyright notice as follows: &quot;&copy; 2016 National Post, a division of Postmedia Network <abbr title="Incorporated">Inc.</abbr> All rights reserved. Unauthorized distribution, transmission or republication strictly prohibited.&quot; </p></dd>

      <h2 id="h-5">Misconceptions about copyright</h2>
      <details><summary>Myth 1:
          My organization bought the product or we are in a contract arrangement with the creator, so it’s okay to reproduce their materials</summary>
       
        
          <p class="lead">Truth</p>
          <p>Unless the contract explicitly contains terms regarding reproduction of materials, a procurement arrangement with a vendor does not automatically entitle your organization to copy the vendor’s materials. The terms of the applicable contract must be reviewed to determine if the desired use is permitted. If the contract’s terms do not deal with the desired use, whether this is posting a manual on the intranet, making copies of a product manual, or making copies of software, then permission must be obtained. Depending on the specific situation, this may mean that the contract will have to be amended. </p>
        </details>
      <details><summary>Myth 2: It’s on the internet, so it’s free for everyone to use it</summary>
        
          <p class="lead">Truth</p>
          <p>The content creator may do as they wish with their own materials, including posting them for viewing on the internet. However, unless the creator has specifically stated that the materials are free to distribute (such as a Creative Commons license allowing free distribution) you must obtain permission. </p>
       </details>
     <details><summary>Myth 3: We bought this image from a stock image company, so we can do whatever we want with it</summary>
          <p class="lead">Truth</p>
          <p>Licensing the use of an image will provide you with the right to use only as per the specified terms of use. The licensing terms will identify the permitted uses, and will also contain limits on what can be done with the images. Often use of the images will be limited to a specific medium, and may be limited in terms of use in other ways. For example, an image may be licensed for a printed publication with less than 100,000 impressions. Posting the image on the internet would require permission and payment of additional fees. </p>
        </details>
      <details><summary>Myth 4: I’m posting this on the intranet. They can’t get past our firewall to see it</summary>
       
          <p class="lead">Truth</p>
          <p>Posting on the intranet or in any electronic medium may be prohibited under the terms of the relevant license. Never assume that a desired use is allowed unless the applicable contract, subscription agreement, or license agreement permits the proposed use. Always check the agreement carefully. As well information posted on InfoZone is not invisible to the general public. While it is true that the public can’t access InfoZone from the internet, any member of the public can submit an <abbr title="Access To Information and Privacy">ATIP</abbr> request for information that is posted on our intranet. </p>
       </details>
     <details><summary>Myth 5: I’m posting a picture of their product, so it’s free advertising for &quot;company name&quot; so I’m sure they won’t mind</summary>
        
          <p class="lead">Truth</p>
          <p>Only the copyright owner has the legal right to decide how their work is used. Therefore, only the copyright owner has the right to make the decision that they wish publicity from sharing of their material, whether it is a photograph, a product manual, or an article. </p>
       </details>
    <details><summary>Myth 6: I’m not posting this to make money, so this use falls under the ‘Fair Dealings’ clause of the Copyright Act </summary>
       
          <p class="lead">Truth</p>
          <p>The Canadian Copyright Act allows for some exceptions to copyright infringement. However the interpretation of situations where these exceptions would apply is complicated and should be left to a lawyer versed in copyright law to decipher. Do not assume that you are within an exception to the Copyright Act. </p>
       </details>
      <h2 id="h-6">Your role if you copy or distribute copyright material</h2>
      <p>If you want to copy or distribute material consider the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assume the material is copyright protected </li>
        <li>Determine the source of the material
          <ul>
            <li>For example, was it obtained from the internet, from a subscription, was it delivered as part of a contract </li>
            <li>Determine if a subscription, license agreement or other contract applies and, if so, what the terms are </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Look at the agreement to determine if a proposed use is permitted </li>
        <li>Determine if a proposed use is permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement or licensing terms and the limitations of that use
          <ul>
            <li>For example:
              <ul>
                <li>Is distribution allowed </li>
                <li>Is copying allowed </li>
                <li>Is there a limit to the number of users for a license </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ask in writing for permission for the specific use if the contract prohibits the use or does not specifically allow it </li>
        <li>Ask in writing for permission for the specific use when there is no license agreement, subscription or contract </li>
        <li>Assume when copying is permitted that the copied material must contain a notice attributing ownership to the copyright owner and a statement prohibiting any further copying </li>
      </ul>
