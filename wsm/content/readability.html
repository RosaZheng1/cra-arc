<h2 id="h-1">Understand the reading level of the audience</h2>
<div class="row"><div class="col-md-8">
      <p>Readability scores indicate how much education your audience must have to understand the words on the page. 
        
        The higher the education, the more likely your audience can absorb the meaning of multi-syllabic words and sentences that are up to 20 words long. </p>
      <p>In Canada, literacy rates are mostly average or below-average. Statistics Canada surveys taken in 1994, 2003 and 2013 reveal that 48% of Canadian adults don’t have the literacy skills they need to live and work in today’s knowledge-based society.  That is why we have mandatory readability rates for genneral population pages.</p>
      <p>Specialized audience page can have a readability rate of up to Grade 15, but be warned. Less than 14% of the population can read at this level. </p>
      <p>Readability does not guarantee comprehension or that your page will be successful. It only means that your audience should be able to absorb the general meaning of the words, not necessarily the point the words are trying to make.</p>
      <p><strong>Remember:</strong> It’s not about you, it’s about your audiences.  Content is often written for management approval instead of for user consumption.  This approach often creates overly complex content.  Complexity is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>unhelpful and bureaucratic</li>
        <li>often perceived as arrogant and deceitful</li>
        <li>leads to distrust</li>
      </ul>
	  </div>
	 <div data-ajax-replace="audience.html #literacy-stats"></div>
	  
	  </div>
      <h2 id="h-2">Determine content reading level</h2>
      <p>Check the reading level of your text. Make sure that it meets the reading level you're targeting based on the literacy needs of your audience. Do this every so often while you're writing content. You can use various tools to do this. </p>
      <p>Readability tools help you check if content is too wordy or complex. Writing content at a reading level above grade 8 can make it difficult for many people to understand or complete their task. </p>
      <p>You can use a readability tool like Flesch-Kincaid to check the reading level of your English content. This tool is available as part of Microsoft Word. It generally reflects the years of education needed to understand the text.</p>
      <p>To use Flesch-Kincaid: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>in Word 2010 and later, click the <strong>File</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Options</strong></li>
        <li>click <strong>Proofing</strong></li>
        <li>under <strong>When correcting spelling and grammar in Word</strong>, make sure the <strong>Check grammar with spelling</strong> check box is selected</li>
        <li>select <strong>Show readability statistics &nbsp;</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can check the reading level of a whole page or just part of a page. To check the reading level:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>accept any tracked changes</li>
        <li>place periods at the end of any bulleted items and headings (remove the periods before publishing) </li>
        <li>highlight the text in your Word document</li>
        <li>click the <strong>Review</strong> tab</li>
        <li>click <strong>Spelling &amp; Grammar</strong></li>
        <li>when Word has finished checking the text, it will ask whether you want to check the rest of the content</li>
        <li>click <strong>No</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>If your text contains technical terms that consist of long, multi-syllable words that you need to use for your specialized audience, remove these terms before you test the content for readability to see whether the surrounding text can be simplified. Reinsert the technical terms once you've simplified the surrounding text.</p>
      <p>The Readability Statistics dialog box will appear and show the Flesch-Kincaid grade level. </p>

          <summary> Figure 2 - Text version </summary>
          <p>A screen capture of Microsoft Word's readability statistics dialog box shows that a sample of text got a Flesch-Kincaid reading level of 5.8.</p>
        </details>
      </figure>
      <p>In newer versions of Microsoft Word, search for "Flesch-Kincaid" using the help feature.</p>
      <h2 id="h-3">Reading level requirements</h2>
		<p>The Flesch-Kincaid grade level result is based on this formula:</p>
		<p>0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) - 15.59</p>
      <p>Evaluate the reading level of content as follows for:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> navigation content (home, theme and topic pages), <strong>aim for no higher than grade 8</strong></li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> all other content intended for general audiences, <strong>aim for grade 8 or lower</strong></li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> content intended for experts, determine the appropriate grade level and apply it across all content for this audience</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="h-4">Verify whether the content is easy to understand</h2>
      <p>Readability tools reveal the reading level of your content, but they can't tell you whether it makes sense. </p>
      <p>To check whether your content is easy to read and understand, test it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ask colleagues who aren't familiar with the subject to review the text for clarity and logic</li>
        <li>work with your communications team to set up usability testing for your content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your content has a high reading level, or if usability testing shows low task completion, try to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>shorten words, sentences or paragraphs, but keep words of 3 or more syllables if they're well known</li>
        <li>replace technical jargon with terms that people will understand</li>
        <li>remove details that people don't need to complete the task</li>
        <li>replace secondary references to a program with "program" rather than using its full name or abbreviation</li>
        <li>create numbered or bulleted lists for key tasks</li>
      </ul>
