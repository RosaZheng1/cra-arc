     <h2 id="h-1">Inverted pyramid concept</h2>
      <p>Organize your content using an inverted pyramid structure:</p>
    <h3>Model</h3>
          <ol class="lst-stps">
            <li><h4>Start with need to know content</h4>
			<p>Start with the most important idea, step or information
            </li>
            <li><h4>Continue with top task and core content</h4>
			<p>This includes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>add details and tasks in order of importance</li>
                <li>keep all task related content in the centre of the page</li>
                <li>use links to direct people to key information and tasks</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Provide supportive content</h4>
              <p>Include information for audiences who want to learn more or have more knowledge of the topic or service, but only if it makes sense</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>End with peripheral content (usually not needed)</h4>
              <p>Add links only if they relate to content that supports completion of the task on the web page (for example, laws or publications)</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <li><strong>Decrease interaction cost:</strong> Users can understand the main point of the page without having to spend a lot of time reading.</li>
          <li><strong>Encourage scrolling:</strong> This structure can encourage scrolling by engaging the audience with the main point, and drawing them in to the details that follow.</li>
          <li><strong>Structure content logically:</strong> Starting with broad information sets the stage for what follows. Elements like anchor or jump links can become unnecessary when content is structured to draw the user down the page.</li>
          <li><strong>Support readers who skim:</strong> Readers can stop reading at any point on the page and still come away with the main point. </li>

	<h2 id="h-2">Importance of a good page heading</h2>
	<p>When a user is scanning, the first piece of content is the page heading. A good heading is important because it sets the expection for what is on the page.</p>
	<p>The page heading also becomes the <code>title</code> of the page, which is what search engines use in search results.  This is important because poor headings produce poor search results.</p>
	<p>Refer to: <a href="../design/standard/components/headings.html">Headings and titles</a></p>
	<h2 id="h-3">Prioritizing information on a navigation page</h2>
	<p>Navigation pages should:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Order items in a logical sequence, if there is a flow or natural order to the navigation links</li>
	<li>Prioritize the most popular navigation links first</li>
	<li>Do a mix of the above, if needed</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id="h-4">Prioritizing information on a content page</h2>
	<p>The core content must always follow the <a href="#h-1">inverted pyramid concept</a>.</p>
<p>	On <strong>longer</strong> content pages, there are additional components you can add to expose important content, without forcing the user to scroll and explore the page:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Add a lead-in page description</li>
	<li>Add a table of contents</li>
	</ul>
      <h3 id="h-4-1">Adding a lead-in page description</h3>
	  <p>A lead-in  page description provides a snapshot of what the page is about.  It is placed directly below the page's heading.</p>
	  <p>Although it is optional on content pages, there is value in having one on <strong>longer</strong> content pages:</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>It provides the user a sense of what the page is about. This can help them decide if they should invest time into reviewing the rest of the page.</li>
	  <li>Google will display a short description below every link on its search result page.  Google does not get this from the metadata and instead will pull a sentence from the content on your page. When there is a lot of content, it may pull a less-than-desirable statement and use that to describe your page in search results. While there is no guarentee that Google will select your lead-in text, if often does.</li>
	
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h3 id="h-4-2">Adding a table of contents</h3>
	  <p>When a page has multiple content blocks that are grouped under various sub-headings, a table of contents helps the user jump down to a specfic section.  The table of contents helps them determine, with little to no scrolling needed, whether that page might have the content they are seeking.</p> 
	  <p>Refer to: <a href="../design/standard/components/toc.html">Table of contents</a></p>
	  <h2 id="h-5">Consider page length</h2>
	  <p>You have to find the right balance between creating pages that are too long or too short.</p>
<ul>
<li>When a page is too long, it can:<ul><li>Overwhelm the user</li>
<li>Create undesirable search engine results, due to the lack of focused content</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When a page is too short, it can:<ul><li>Leave the user thinking they have the full picture, when they do not</li><li>Leave the user thinking they do <strong>not</strong> have the full picture, yet they may be uncertain how to get to the related content</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

 <p>There is no hard-and-fast rule to determine the perfect page size.  However, you can <a href="structure.html">use effective content structure</a> to help group and organize content.  This will help you determine how to break up content, which will support you in determining what to put on a page, and when to create a suite of pages.</p>
      <div class="row">
	  <div class="col-md-8">
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <p> What do users hate more: long pages full of information that require lengthy scrolling or having to drill down through multiple&mdash;albeit shorter&mdash;pages to find what they need? Ask them, and they&rsquo;ll often say, "We hate scrolling." But usability tests say otherwise. Folks don&rsquo;t seem to mind scrolling, as long as they believe that it will eventually pay off. </p>
        <p> In the trade-off between hiding content below the fold or spreading it across several pages, users have greater success when the content is on a single page. However, if you&rsquo;re going to go with longer pages, you&rsquo;d better make sure that your users can easily find the information they need. </p>
        <p> Create pages that are easy to scan. That have a consistent structure. That allow users to jump right to where they want to be. </p>
