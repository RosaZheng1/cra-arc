         <h3 id="h-1-1">Create clear paths to information (a scent of information)</h3>
         <p>Users  hunt for information. They arrive on a web page and scan the content in search of information. If they cannot find what  they are searching for, they continue their hunt by following a link to another  page. How do they choose the next link? They virtually sniff out the link that has  the strongest scent. This practice is known as following the scent of  information.</p>
      <p>With  this user behaviour in mind, it is crucial to use descriptive links which closely resemble the title or heading of the destination page. Vague, poorly named, obscure, or  incomplete links decreases the scent and frustrates users. Sometimes it leads them  to abandon their hunt. In addition to descriptive <a href="links.html">links</a>, users pick up the  scent of information from <a href="images.html">images</a> and the layout. </p>
      <p>Xerox  researchers, Peter Pirolli and Wai Tat-Fu, developed the information foraging  theory, which is the precursor to the scent of information theory.</p>
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <p>...(1) users working on unfamiliar tasks are expected to choose links that have high information scent, (2) users will leave a site when the information scent of the site diminishes below a certain threshold</p>

            <h3 id="h-1-2">Write useful page headings</h3>
      <p>The title of the page, known as the heading 1 (H1), must accurately describe what's on the page. A descriptive page title is important because search engines often display the title without the context that the rest of the page provides.</p>
      <p>Most people scan page titles and headings, looking for keywords that will confirm that they have found what they're looking for. People who use assistive technology may listen for keywords using software or may use keyboard shortcuts to access all the headings on a page.</p>
      <p>When writing a page title, heading or subheading, make sure that it: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>gives a clear idea of what follows </li>
        <li>is short and contains no unnecessary words </li>
        <li>contains the most relevant terms at the beginning </li>
        <li>makes sense on its own</li>
        <li>is followed by text and not by another heading, unless the heading introduces a table of contents on the same page </li>
        <li>has no punctuation at the end</li>
        <li>contains no abbreviation unless the audience knows it better than it knows its long-form equivalent </li>
        <li>contains no promotional messaging (boastful, subjective claims) because it might confuse and stop people from navigating to the page </li>
      </ul>
      <section class="alert alert-info provisional">
        <h4>Tip: structure your content with automated style features</h4>
        <p>Use the automated styles feature of your word processing software to structure headings. The styles feature clearly differentiates headings from content and helps you format headings consistently.</p>
        <p>Having clear and consistently formatted headings helps your web team produce the web pages more quickly and with fewer errors.</p>
      </section>
	  <h4>Examples of incorrect use of page headings</h4>
      <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Examples below are used for learning purposes, not to judge the organizations or people designing these interfaces.</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li class="mrgn-bttm-xl">
          <p><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> Here is the Canada.ca search result for the keyword &quot;France&quot;. The first two links are very descriptive, which is excellent.</p>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-fail1a.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-fail1a.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <p>Search engines don't actually determine the page name from the page's title (heading 1 or H1) as it appears to the page visitors. They get it from the page’s metadata tag - a line of invisible code near the top of the page, the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. In this case, the titles of the above two search results are: </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd wb-prettify">
            <li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;title&gt;Travel Advice and Advisories for France&lt;/title&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;title&gt;Embassies and consulates | France&lt;/title&gt;</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>The problem arises when you go to each of those two pages. Their page title (<code>H1</code>) doesn't match the title displayed in search results  (<code>title</code>). While page title and links to it don’t always have to match, it is usually safer to follow the general rule of having an exact match.</p>
          <p>When you allow for modifications, you can run into problems where both page titles  (<code>H1</code>s) are the same. This risks confusing the user, especially because neither one of these pages is the mainpage for everything Canada.ca has to say about France. </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Title:</strong> Travel Advice and Advisories for France </li>
            <li><strong>H1:</strong> France </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-fail1b-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-fail1b-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Title:</strong> Embassies and consulates | France </li>
            <li><strong>H1: </strong>France </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-fail1c-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-fail1c-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <p>Lastly, any other page wanting to create a link to these pages may misinterpret the scope of the page. If they create a link on their site called "France", it would give their users the impression that this is the Government of Canada's main page about France.</p>
          <p><strong>Remember:  Anytime you mismatch the <code>title</code> metadata and the page title
            (<code>H1</code>), you could create problems. Problems that become evident in search as well as on sites or pages that choose to directly link to your pages. </strong></p>
        </li>
        <li class="mrgn-bttm-xl">
          <p><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> Branded products often lose context when detached from a pre-dermined flow of information.</p>
          <p>For example, the primary application to view your personal taxes is "My Account". This broadly-named branded approach means a search for "my account" on Canada.ca produces undesirable results, as lots of pages have the words "my" and "account". </p>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-fail2-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-fail2-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li><strong>English search result</strong>: Although the "My Account - Help" and "My Account - What's new" pages make it into the top 10 search results, the main "My Account" page isn't there. "My account" is found on the <strong>second page</strong> of search results, as the third result. </li>
            <li><strong>French search result</strong>: The French branded term has better success in surfacing the link. <span lang="fr">"Mon dossier"</span> is found on the first page of search results, as the third result. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>This means a user would have to go into a child page of "My Account" and then double back to the main page.</p>
          <p>Even if a user has more expert search skills and puts "my account" in quotation marks, which will search for the exact term, rather than 2 words separately, it will not retrieve only the CRA "My Account" as it also retrieves "My CFIA" account, creating opportunity for confusion. </p>
          <p><strong>Always be careful of branding products.</strong> If it's absolutely necessary, make sure it is descriptive and logical so it makes sense when accessed from different points of discovery. </p>
          <strong>Remember: Branded products may not resonate with the user, especially when they are featured out-of-context. Additionally, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/category-names-suck/
">it can be hard to locate services and resources that have a made-up or generic name</a>. </strong> </li>
        <li class="mrgn-bttm-xl">
          <p><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> Although the title says "For Canadians", it's actually just immigration and citizenship information for Canadians. </p>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-fail3a-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-fail3a-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a></div>
          <p>Of course, this isn't a problem if the user arrived on this page from its parent "Immigration and citizenship" page, but from Google's perspective, it looks like the Canada.ca's main page for everything a Canadian would need to know: </p>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-fail3b-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-fail3b-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a></div>

          <p><strong>Remember:  Headings also tie into findability, which also includes search engine findability, not just links from pages you expected the user to navigate from. </strong></p>
        </li>
        <li class="mrgn-bttm-xl">
          <p><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> When navigating through a process, where users can enter from any point, including step numbers in the page title could confuse users. </p>
          <p>If a user arrives on this page after completing Step 1, it makes sense that "Step 2" is in the title. 
           
            However, if the search engine or another page took them here, the user may think: "This is Step 2 Eligibility. Does that mean there is also a Step 1 Eligibility? Am I missing a section of information or is this the starting point for eligibility?" </p>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-fail4-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-fail4-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <p>You can put step numbers in a process where the user has to go through the entire flow, one step at time, with no jumping ahead or having access to only parts of the entire process. This would be a sequential journey and it would have no 'front doors' (the only way to get to step 2 is to complete step 1). An example of this type of process would be online checkout, or account registration, etc. </p>
          <p>If this type of process is the right fit for your context and users, you would only index (let the search engine find) one page of the whole process - the landing page which starts with Step 1. This way, users will always start their journey at the beginning. </p>
          <p><strong>Remember: When a process can be entered from multiple points, including the search engine, then showing the step number in the page title could confuse users. </strong></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="h-1-3">Make the page title unique</h3>
      <p>Most search engines identify relevant search results based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>page title </li>
        <li>headings </li>
        <li>subheadings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They display the page title as a link on the results page.</p>
      <p>Unique page titles help search engines tell the difference between similar pages. They also help ensure that people don't need to look at many pages with the same name to find the information they need.</p>
      <p>Check whether your page title is unique by using a search engine. Search for the title of the page followed by "site:" and the domain extension (for example, "food&nbsp;safety&nbsp;site:gc.ca" or "food&nbsp;safety&nbsp;site:canada.ca"). </p>
	  <h4>Example of incorrect use of unique page titles</h4>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li class="mrgn-bttm-xl">
          <p><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> Many content authors and webmasters forget that the content they create, while it may make sense in the flow of the localized content they create, may lose context when the user searches for information. This means that page headings have to be named uniquely and with context. </p>
          <p>In this case, the Canada.ca site has so many "Contact us" pages, without the additional information in the title as to who is being contacted, that the results search engine returns makes it impossible for users to make informed and effortless choices.</p>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/choices-fail6-e.jpg"><img src="images/choices-fail6-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The name given to the page becomes what other pages call it when they link to it. Therefore, the page heading must be descriptive, unique, and aware of how it fits into the whole site or information system made up of multiple sites. A page title might make sense in the context of the page or on the parent page that linked to it; however, it might not make sense when seen in search results. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <section class="alert alert-info provisional">
        <h4>Tip: use tools to check content structure</h4>
        <p>Use these tools:</p>
        <h5>Table of contents</h5>
        <p>Use the table of contents feature from your Word processing software to automatically generate a table of contents based on the heading levels in your document. Then, check the table of contents to make sure you've correctly structured the page title, headings and subheadings.</p>
        <p>Delete the table of contents before you send the document for approval if it isn't required for the final online version.</p>
        <h5>Navigation pane</h5>
        <p>Use the navigation pane feature in Microsoft Word. When you select Find (or press Control + F), a small window will display all the headings in your document.</p>
      </section>
      <h3 id="h-1-4">Front-load keywords</h3>
      <p>The  first thing users see on a web page is the title. The title must instantly  convey the type of information the page contains. The page title must also be unique so users do not confuse one page with another.</p>
      <p>Make  headings clear and descriptive to help guide users to the information they are looking for. <a href="./../../content/data.html#h-1">Include keywords</a> in headings, particularly in the <strong>first two  words</strong> to help users scan more easily. </p>

      <p>There  are different approaches to writing for print and writing for web. This applies  to headings as well.</p>
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <p>(In) an article in <em>The New York Times </em>about tall people's travails on the road: "Coping With the Tall Traveler's Curse.",...(the) headline itself is actually an example of the differences between print and online content style: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In print, a phrase like "tall traveler's curse" is a bit enticing and   might draw readers in. Because the article featured a photo of a tall   guy crunched in the back of a taxi, the article's content was clear to   anybody glancing at that page in the newspaper</li>
          <li>In contrast, putting the same headline online would fail several  guidelines for writing for the Web :
            <ul>
              <li>The first 3 words have no information-carrying content. On the Web, you must start with words like "tall traveler" because users often  scan down the left part of a list of items. They never see the last words in a link unless the first few words attract their attention</li>
              <li>The headline lacks keywords &mdash; such as "airline seat" and "hotel bed" &mdash; that are important for   search engine optimization (<abbr title="search engine optimization">SEO</abbr>). No one will search "curse" when trying   to find out which hotel chains offer extra-long beds or which airline   seats are the least unpleasant for long-legged travelers</li>
              <li>The words "tall traveler's curse" are insufficiently specific to tell users what the story is about. Because headlines are often   presented as plain links removed from the article itself, the photo of   the poor guy in the cab won't be there to explain the story's content.   Online, the headline alone must provide enough  information scent to let users predict what they'll get if they follow the link</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

            <h3 id="h-1-5">Capitalization in headings</h3>
         <ul>
        <li>Capitalize the first letter of the first word (sentence case) of all page titles, headings, subheadings, table captions and table headers</li>
        <li>Capitalize proper nouns in page titles, headings and subheadings</li>
        <li>Don't use punctuation at the end of page titles, headings and subheadings </li>
      </ul>
            <h3 id="h-1-6">Punctuation in headings</h3>
          <ul>
        <li>You may use punctuation at the end of page titles, headings and subheadings for campaign slogans </li>
        <li>Only use question marks when asking for information in a form, wizard, survey or quiz</li>
      </ul>

	  <h3 id="h-1-7">Structure of headings</h3>
	  <p>The page title, headings and subheadings help people find information on the screen easily. Use headings to divide text into logical sections approximately every 200 words.</p>
      <p>Structuring headings clearly helps establish the authority of one heading over another.</p>
      <p><strong>Sub-headings  make large blocks of text easier to read and scan.</strong> Ensure that sub-headings are  clear, concise and in <a href="#">parallel structure</a>.</p>
      <p>Good headings and sub-headings  are essential to making web content accessible. Screen reader users  can use the headings and sub-headings to navigate quickly between sections, and  to better understand or summarize content.</p>
      <p>For the page <strong>title</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>use this style: Heading 1</li>
        <li>apply a Heading 1 only once per page </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the <strong>main sections</strong>: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>use this style: Heading 2</li>
        <li>can appear many times</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For <strong>subsections</strong>: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>use this style: Heading 3</li>
        <li>can appear many times and in many main sections</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For <strong>sub-subsections</strong>: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>use this style: Heading 4 (and so on)</li>
        <li>can appear many times in many subsections</li>
      </ul>
      <section class="alert alert-info provisional">
        <h3 class="h4">Tip: publication and program titles usually don't make good web page titles</h3>
        <p>Using the titles of reports, brochures, publications or programs as the web page title can make it difficult for people to find your content, even if it relates to their task.</p>
        <p>The titles of publications are usually not written in plain language, short enough or descriptive enough.</p>
        <p>To help make sure your page ranks high in search results, use page titles that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>are short</li>
          <li>describe the page accurately </li>
          <li>are relevant to what people type into search engines</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mrgn-tp-lg">When you post a publication online, you must adapt it for the web. Here are some things you can do to get better results: </p>
        <h4>Write a title that describes the contents of the page</h4>
        <p>The web page title (Heading1) is the title you see at the top of the page when you're looking at it. Make sure that it accurately describes, in plain language, what your publication is about. </p>
        <h4>Use the first paragraph to introduce your publication </h4>
        <p>The first paragraph of your web page should introduce your publication in plain language. It helps people who've landed on the page decide whether they've found what they are looking for. You can include the title of your publication here. </p>
        <h4>Include keywords in the page's metadata </h4>
        <p>Use the title tag and the description metadata field to improve where your publication ranks in search results. Here's what you can do: </p>
        <p><strong>Title tag</strong>: The page title tag is the blue hyperlinked text you see when a search engine generates a list of results. Write an effective page title (Heading1), and use it as your title tag. </p>
        <p><strong>Description metadata field</strong>: The description metatdata is the content you see under the blue hyperlinked text in search results. <strong>Avoid listing only keywords</strong>, because search engines might ignore these. Write 1 or 2 short sentences that summarize the page. Make sure they contain keywords that people use when searching for your content (for example, abbreviations familiar to your audience). </p>
        <p>Refer to: <a href="../../../content/plain.html">Use plain language</a> and <a href="../../../content/data.html#h-1">Identify user's keywords</a> </p>
