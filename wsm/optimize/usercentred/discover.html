	<h2 id="h-1">Analyze data</h2>
	<p>In this phase, all available data is analyzed to identify issues with the content and navigation of the relevant web pages. The data that may be analyzed includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>page content </li>
<li>User Feedback Tool data</li>
<li>research Data </li>
<li>web analytics</li>
<li>SEO data</li>
<li>existing UX testing results</li>
<li>Call Centre data</li>
<li>social media</li>
</ul>
<h3>User feedback data</h3>
<p>The feedback tool is a mechanism embedded into specific web page on Canada.ca. Users can use the feedback tool to report issues with content on a page.</p>
<h4>Specific factors to examine</h4>
<ul>
<li>Compare call drivers with user feedback data and note any inconsistencies or overlap</li>
<li>Verify the problem statements from program areas with the data from the feedback tool to check for issue alignment</li>
<li>Assess recurring issues that affect multiple users</li>
<li>Determine if there are content gaps (missing content) </li>
<li>Identify pages that may need to be linked or merged</li>
<li>Analyze findability and information architecture issues with existing content</li>
<li>Prioritize the issues found to create a preliminary usability test plan</li>
</ul>
<h3>Call Centre data</h3>
<p>Phone calls received by the Call Centre are analyzed to determine the reason for the call. It’s important to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>why the user is calling</li>
<li>what task they were trying to complete on Canada.ca and what barriers they encountered with the web pages/content that led to them to call</li>
</ul>
<h4>Call drivers</h4>
<p>Knowing why individuals are contacting the Call Centre helps to determine areas where there are issues with the web content.</p>  

<p>Call drivers with <strong>high traffic</strong> on their related web content could indicate that the:</p>  
<ul>
<li>web content is difficult to understand, so users call for clarification</li> 
<li>web content is insufficient, so users have to call to complete their tasks </li> 
<li>the user found the wrong web page and as a result, couldn’t find the information they require</li> 
</ul>
<p>Call drivers with <strong>low traffic</strong> on their related web content could indicate that users have difficulty searching and give up before finding what they need.</p>  

<p>Call drivers that have <strong>little-to-no</strong> related web content may only be solvable by calling. In this case, there may be an opportunity to create new content to address users’ needs.</p>  
<h4>News articles and social media</h4>
<p>News articles and social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit are frequently monitored for mentions related to the relevant CRA web services to identify pages involved  recurring issues users may be experiencing.</p>
	<h2 id="h-2">Host a task scenario workshop</h2>
	<p>The issues identified when analyzing the data from the various sources mentioned above are used to create job stories. These are developed during a task scenario workshop with input from subject matter experts (SMEs) and the project team.</p>
	<h3>Objective of the task scenario workshop</h3>

<p>The objective of the workshop is to identify real world problems by crafting job stories which will help in creating tasks that users will attempt to complete during user testing.</p>


<h3>Job stories</h3>
<p>Job stories are used to craft the task scenarios.</p>

<p>A job story is a tool that helps you understand the user’s needs when they interact with the website.<p>

<p>In general, a job story is structured based on the idea that an individual will use a product in a particular situation, to achieve a desired outcome:<p>
<blockquote>
<p>When &lt;situation&gt;, I want to &lt;motivation&gt;, so I can &lt;expected outcome&gt;</p></blockquote>
<details><summary>Example: Job story</summary>
<blockquote><p><strong>When</strong> I’m feeling ill, <strong>I want to</strong> check if it is a cold or flu, <strong>so I can</strong> decide whether to stay home. </p></blockquote>
</details>

<p>To create a job story, the <strong>situation</strong>, <strong>motivation</strong>, and <strong>outcome</strong>, is informed by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call Centre data and trends: 
<ul>
<li>Why are users calling?</li>
<li>What were they trying to do before deciding to call?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>web analytics:
<ul>
<li>What information are users seeking on the website and why didn’t they find it?</li>
<li>How are they navigating through our current content?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>subject matter experts:
<ul>
<li>What do our users need to do to?</li>
<li>How do they currently perform the task?</li>
<li>Where do they struggle in the process?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h-3">Creating task scenarios</h2>
<p>Once job stories have been crafted, the team will create task scenarios based on the highest priority that's required for testing.</p>
<h3>What task scenarios are</h3>

<p>During user testing, participants are asked to complete tasks. A <strong>task</strong> is an activity a user would typically perform when using the website. For example, searching Canada.ca, to learn about deadlines and installment payments.</p>
<p>A <strong>scenario</strong> provides an explanation and context as to why the test participant is completing the task.</p> 
<p>Combining the action the participant will attempt and the context for completing it, creates a <strong>task scenario</strong>.</p>
<details><summary>Example: Task scenario</summary>
<p>Sandy isn’t sure how to file a tax return since it’s her first time not using an accountant. Her friend told her to use TurboTax. Can Sandy file her 2020 taxes online with TurboTax?</p>
</details>
<p>The task scenarios must:<p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> <strong>be realistic:</strong> involve real tasks that users would typically perform on pages</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> <strong>be actionable:</strong> include a goal that user is working towards by completing the task
</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> <strong>avoid giving away the answer:</strong> the task needs to be worded differently than the content on a page, so users don’t just match headings and words without reading.</li>
</ul>
	<h2 id="h-4">Create a test plan for baseline usability testing
</h2>
	<p>Once the task scenarios have been developed, the next step is to create a test plan. A test plan is a document that provides details about the testing, as well as the post-test feedback that will be solicited. In the plan you will find:</p>
	<ul>
	

<li>when the test will be conducted</li>
<li>the program that will be used to administer the test (example: TryMyUI)</li>
<li>the type of testing – eg. moderated or unmoderated </li>
<li>which platform (mobile,desktop  or both) will be tested</li>
<li>length of time participants have to complete the test</li>
<li>a list of task scenarios each participant will be asked to complete</li>
<li>the testing metrics (KPIs) that will be used:
<ul>
<li>a 20% point increase in both findability and task success, or a rate of 80% in findability and task success</li>
<li>Ease of use scale</li>
<li>System Usability Scale (SUS)</li>
<li>Time on task</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Participants:
<ul>
<li>number of test participants; typically 18 to 20 individuals </li>
<li>user recruitment methods</li>
<li>recruitment screening criteria  (for example, employed and unemployed individuals aged 18 to 65) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

	<h2 id="h-5">Conduct baseline usability testing</h2>
	
	<p>During baseline testing,  users attempt to complete the task scenarios.</p> 


<p><strong>Baseline</strong> testing is conducted to review <strong>existing content</strong> and navigation of web pages in their current state. Seeing how the user interacts with the pages and the issues they encounter when attempting to complete the task scenarios helps to determine specific improvements that need to be made.</p> 

<h3>After testing is complete</h3>

<p>Gather data in the UX scorecard template/Usability Performance Dashboard (UPD) to share with the stakeholders, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>time on task</li>
<li>task success</li>
<li>ease of Use</li>
<li>SUS and Summary questionnaire & data</li>
<li>observations</li>
<li>Design, IA, content recommendations</li>
</ul>



<p>In the next phase of the project (Designing), a prototype of the pages is created with the specific improvements identified in the baseline testing.</p>
