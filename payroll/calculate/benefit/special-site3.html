<h4 id="special">Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you paid an allowance or reimburse your employee, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if <strong>all </strong>of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee was required by employment duties to be away for at least 36 hours (step 2)</li>

<details><summary>Examples</summary>
<h4>Example 1 - CRA administrative policy does not apply</h4>
<p>A northern community hires Simon to come teach at the local school. The contract is for 1 year. Simon keeps his apartment for the duration of his contract. Simon receives an allowance for board and lodging.</p>
<p>The CRA administrative policy <strong>does not </strong>apply because the work is <strong>not </strong>temporary.</p>
<p>The position of "teacher" will exist for as long as the school exists, and it cannot be considered temporary, even though the individual currently in this position has a contract for a limited time.</p>
<p>The temporary nature of the duties is from the employer's point of view, not the employee's.</p>

<h4>Example 2 - CRA administrative policy applies</h4>
<p>Diane is an engineer who lives and works in Montréal, where she maintains a self-contained domestic establishment. She's superving the initial phase of a project in Toronto. The initial phase is for 2 years. The employer provides Annie with lodging in Toronto. Diane and her employee also filled out Form TD4 Declaration of Exemption - Employment at a Special Work Site. Employer kept a copy with her records.</p>
<p>The CRA administrative policy <strong>applies</strong> based on the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Work is temporary </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Employee maintained a self-contained domestic establishment in Montréal for her personal use </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Diane has to stay in Toronto for over 36 hours </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Form TD4 is completed and employer kept a copy </li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 3 - Income Tax Act applies</h4>
<p>Peter works at a special work site and receives an allowance of $150 per day for board and lodging. This allowance is exempt from income tax under 6(6) of the ITA. On weekends, Peter does not stay on the work site and his employee gives him a check-out allowance of $300. This allowance is equal to the allowance the employee waives when he leaves the site. (2 X $150 per day)</p>
<p>The Income Tax Act <strong>applies</strong> because the check-out allowance is reasonable.</p>

<h4>Example 4 - CRA administrative policy does not apply</h4>
<p>Mary works as a crew member of the Pearl. Because the vessel is undergoing repairs, Mary is off work for three weeks. However, her employer is allowing her to remain on board, free of charge, while the repairs are being completed.</p>

<p>The conditions are not met because the vessel is not at sea. The employer must add the FMV of the meals and lodging (stay on board the ship) to Mary's income.</p>
</details>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the benefit <strong>does not</strong> meet <strong>all</strong> of the above conditions, the benefit is taxable.</p>

<details><summary>Calculate: Accommodations you own - <strong>Prescribed zones</strong> that <strong>do not</strong> have developed rental markets </summary>
<p>In places in prescribed zones without developed rental markets, you have to use other methods to set a value on the housing benefit. The method you use depends on whether you own the residence or rent it from a third party.</p>
<p>If you provide both rent and utilities and can calculate their cost as separate items, you have to determine their value separately. Add both items to get the value of the housing benefit.</p>
<p>If your employee reimburses you for all or part of their rent or utilities, determine the benefit as explained below. Subtract any amount reimbursed by your employee and include the amount that remains in their income.</p>
<details><summary>Ceiling amounts for housing benefits</summary>
<p>The ceiling amount for housing benefits is the maximum amount you can include in an employee's income if the employee does not pay any expenses related to housing or utilities.</p>
<p>The following table shows the <strong>monthly ceiling </strong>for housing benefits (including GST/HST) for the years 2023 and 2022, by type of housing and utilities.</p>
