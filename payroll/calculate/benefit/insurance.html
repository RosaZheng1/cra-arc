<p class="mrgn-bttm-lg">Depending on your situation, the benefit may not be taxable under the <a href="#adminpolicy" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">CRA's administrative policy&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> or the Income Tax Act.</p>

<h3>Situations</h3>

<details><summary>Situation: You pay premiums for a <strong>group life</strong> insurance policy</summary>
<h4 id="life">Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you pay premiums for a <strong>group life insurance</strong> policy (such as a group term life insurance policy) for your current employee, former employee or a retired employee, the amount you paid for premiums is a taxable benefit. </p>
<details><summary>What is a group term life insurance policy</summary>
<h5>Group term life insurance policy</h5>
<p>A group term life insurance policy is one for which the only amounts payable by the insurer are policy dividends, experience rating refunds, and amounts payable on the death or disability of a current employee, former employee, retired employee, or their covered dependents.</p>
<h5>Term insurance</h5>
<p>Term insurance is any life insurance under a group term life insurance policy other than insurance for which a lump-sum premium has become payable or has been paid. Life insurance for current employees would usually be term insurance, although it is sometimes provided for retired employees.</p>
<h5>Lump-sum premium</h5>
<p>A lump-sum premium is a premium for insurance on an individual's life where all or part of the premium is for insurance for a period that extends more than 13 months after the payment of the premium (or more than 13 months after the time the premium became payable, if it is paid after it became payable).</p>
</details>
<hr>
<p><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg text-success"></span> You must report the taxable benefit using code 40 on a T4 slip (current employee and employee on leave of absence) or code 119 on a T4A slip (former employee or retired employee).</p>

<details><summary>Situation: You pay premiums or you make contributions to a <strong>provincial or territorial hospital</strong>, <strong>medical care</strong> insurance plan or certain Government of Canada plans</summary>
<h4 id="provincial">Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you <strong>have</strong> to pay the <strong>employer health tax</strong> in the provinces of <strong>Ontario</strong> or <strong>British Columbia (as of 2019)</strong> it is <strong>not</strong> a taxable benefit provided by the employer because the payment of these premiums is <strong>not</strong> considered to be a payment of premiums for a provincial or territorial hospital medical care insurance plan on behalf of your employee.</p>
<p>Learn more about the programs: <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/document/employer-health-tax-eht">Employer Health Tax (EHT) | Province of Ontario</a> and <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/employer-health-tax/employer-health-tax-overview">Employer health tax | Province of British Columbia</a></p>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you pay premiums or you make contributions to a provincial or territorial hospital or medical care insurance plan for your current employee, former employee or a retired employee, the amount you pay is a taxable benefit.</p>
<p>If you reimburse (as an employer) your employee for the cost of the premium, it is considered a <strong>cash</strong> benefit.</p>

<h5>Premiums or contributions made by the Government of Canada</h5>
<p>If premiums or contributions are made by the Government of Canada to a hospital or medical insurance plans for its employees and their dependents <strong>serving outside Canada</strong>, the amounts paid are a taxable benefit. This also applies to dependents of members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Forces serving outside Canada.</p>

<ul>
<li>A <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr> may form part of an employee health and welfare program or package administered by a trust. However, in order for the <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr> to receive tax free treatment, that portion of the program or package that is a <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr> must be identified, administered and accounted for separately; otherwise, the total package will be treated as an employee benefit plan or as an employee trust. </li>
<li>Medical and hospital insurance plans offered by private insurance companies, such as Blue Cross and the Group Surgical Medical Insurance Plan that covers federal government employees, are considered <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr>'s. </li>
<li>An employer may agree under the terms of a collective agreement to reimburse employees for medical expenses incurred by the employee or the employee's dependents. Such an arrangement may qualify as a <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr> if it contains medical expenses set out in 118.2(2). The plan does not need to be administered by an independent trustee, but may be administered by the employer. Where there is no such formal plan, employer payments for medical expenses would likely be a direct medical expense taxable benefit. </li>
<li>A "cost plus" plan is one in which the employer contracts with a trusteed plan or insurance company to pay certain defined medical expenses of the employee. The employer then reimburses the agent for such claims, plus an administration fee. The employee's contract of employment requires the employer to reimburse the plan or insurance company for proper claims paid and a contract exists between the plan, or insurance company, and the employee for payment of claims for the defined risks. If the risks covered by the plan are those set out in 118.2(2), the plan will qualify as a <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr>. </li>

<h4>Insured plan (plan is backed by a contract of insurance)</h4>
<p>An insured plan meets the "all or substantially all" (generally 90% or more) requirement if “all or substantially all” of the <strong>premiums </strong>paid in the calendar year relate to medical expenses that are eligible for the METC.</p>
<p>The <strong>benefits </strong>paid to employees in the calendar year are not considered in determining whether the plan meets the “all or substantially all” requirement.</p>
<p>The following example explains when the “all or substantially all” requirement will be met for an insured plan.</p>

<p>This plan meets the “all or substantially all” requirement because 92% (70% + 10% + 12%) of the premiums paid relate to medical expenses that are eligible for the METC, while 8% of the premiums relate to other medical expenses. The fact that only 87% (69% + 11% + 7%) of the total benefits paid relate to medical expenses that are eligible for the METC is not relevant in determining whether the plan qualifies as a <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Self-insured plan (plan is not backed by a contract of insurance)</h4>
<p>When a plan is not backed by a contract of insurance, the CRA considers it to be a self-insured plan.</p>
<p>A self-insured plan meets the “all or substantially all” (generally 90% or more) requirement for a calendar year if “all or substantially all” of the <strong>benefits paid </strong>to <strong>all employees </strong>that year are for medical expenses that are eligible for the METC.</p>
<p>The following example explains when the “all or substantially all” requirement will be met for a self-insured plan.</p>

<p>This plan meets the “all or substantially all” requirement because the benefits paid to <strong>all employees </strong>in the year for medical expenses that are eligible for the METC represent 93% ($9,000 + $3,000 + $800) of the total benefits ($13,800) paid.</p>
</details>
<p>If you provide benefits through a self-insured plan that consists of health care spending accounts (HCSAs), the method for determining whether the plan satisfies the “all or substantially all” requirement for a particular calendar year is the same as for self-insured plans that do not consist of a HCSA. The employees' allocation of the ceiling amount to the various types of expense in an HCSA is not considered.</p>
<p>Most employers that offer HCSAs do so under one group plan. However, in rare circumstances, each HCSA can be considered a separate insurance plan. The determination of whether one group plan or several individual plans exist must be based on the law and the facts of the case. For more information on HCSAs, see paragraphs 14 to 18 of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it529/archived-flexible-employee-benefit-programs.html">Interpretation Bulletin IT-529, Flexible Employee Benefit Programs</a>.</p>
<p>The following example explains when self-insured HCSAs would meet the “all or substantially all” requirement.</p>

<details><summary>Example - Health care spending accounts</summary>
<p>Company BBB provides one self-insured group plan that consists of three HCSAs, each with a $5,000 ceiling amount.  At the start of the calendar year, each employee allocates the $5,000 ceiling, as shown in the table below.</p>

<p>The plan shown above meets the “all or substantially all” requirement. The total benefits paid to all employees that year for expenses that are eligible for the METC are 92% ($11,500) of the total benefits paid ($12,525). The fact that the total ceiling amounts allocated for expenses that are eligible for the METC ($12,000) are only 80% of the total ceiling amount, eligible and non-eligible ($15,000), is not relevant in determining whether the plan meets the “all or substantially all” requirement.</p>
<p>However, if each HCSA is determined to be a separate plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ann's plan satisfies the “all or substantially all” requirement because the benefits she received for expenses that are eligible for the METC are 95% ($4,000) of the total benefits ($4,200) that she received in the year. </li>
<li>Sue's plan does not satisfy the “all or substantially all” requirement because the benefits she received for expenses that are eligible for the METC are only 83% ($3,250) of the total benefits ($3,900) she received in the year. </li>
<li>Jim's plan satisfies the “all or substantially all” requirement because the benefits he received for expenses that are eligible for the METC are 96% ($4,250) of the total benefits ($4,425) he received in the year. </li>
</ul>
</details>
<h4>Multiple plans</h4>
<p>Whether one or multiple plans exist is a question of fact and law. Multiple plans cannot be combined in determining if the “all or substantially all” requirement has been satisfied.</p>

<p>An employer paid $2,000 in premiums for group term life insurance for their employee as a benefit from employment in the province of Manitoba. The insurance plan has regularly paid premiums and the rate does not vary based on age or gender. As Manitoba has an insurance levy of 7% for insurance coverage, the employer paid $140 in levies on this premium. The employer had also paid $200 in sales and excise taxes on the insurance coverage. The employee did not reimburse the employer for any premiums or taxes. </p>
