<h3>Situations</h3>

<details><summary>Situation: You pay premiums for a <strong>group life</strong> insurance plans</summary>
<h4 id="life">Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you pay premiums for a <strong>group life insurance</strong> plan (such as a group term life plan) for your employer, former employee or a retiree, the benefit is taxable. </p>
<details><summary>What is a group term life insurance policy</summary>
<h5>Group term life insurance policy</h5>
<p>A group term life insurance policy is one for which the only amounts payable by the insurer are policy dividends, experience rating refunds, and amounts payable on the death or disability of an employee, former employee, retired employee, or their covered dependents.</p>
<h5>Term insurance</h5>
<p>Term insurance is any life insurance under a group term life insurance policy other than insurance for which a lump-sum premium has become payable or has been paid. Life insurance for current employees would usually be term insurance, although it is sometimes provided for retired employees.</p>
<h5>Lump-sum premium</h5>
<p>A lump-sum premium is a premium for insurance on an individual's life where all or part of the premium is for insurance for a period that extends more than 13 months after the payment of the premium (or more than 13 months after the time the premium became payable, if it is paid after it became payable).</p>

<details><summary>Situation: You pay premiums or you make contributions to <strong>hospital</strong> or <strong>medical care</strong> insurance plans</summary>
<h4 id="provincial">Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you <strong>have</strong> to pay premiums for <strong>health tax</strong> in the province of <strong>Ontario</strong> or <strong>British Columbia (as of 2019)</strong> and it is based on the amount of your payroll, the benefit is not taxable.</p>

<p>It is not considered a taxable benefit provided by the employer because these premiums are made by your employee.</p>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you pay premiums or you make contributions to provincial, territorial or federal hospital, or medical care insurance plans for an employee, former employee or a retiree, the benefit is taxable.</p>
<p>This includes when the premiums or contributions are made by <strong>Government of Canada</strong> to the following <strong>recipients</strong>:</p>
 <ul class="fa-ul">
 <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Their employees, former employees or retirees.</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Their employee's dependents serving outside Canada.</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Their employee's dependents of members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Forces serving outside Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an employer, if you reimburse your employee for the cost of the premium, it is considered a <strong>cash</strong> taxable benefit.</p>

<li>A <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr> may form part of an employee health and welfare program or package administered by a trust.

<li>Medical and hospital insurance plans offered by private insurance companies, such as Blue Cross and the Group Surgical Medical Insurance Plan that covers federal government employees, are considered <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr>'s. </li>
<li>An employer may agree under the terms of a collective agreement to reimburse employees for medical expenses incurred by the employee or the employee's dependents. Such an arrangement may qualify as a <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr> if it contains medical expenses set out in 118.2(2). The plan need not be administered by an independent trustee, but may be administered by the employer. Where there is no such formal plan, employer payments for medical expenses would likely be a direct medical expense taxable benefit. </li>
<li>A "cost plus" plan is one in which the employer contracts with a trusteed plan or insurance company to pay certain defined medical expenses of the employee. The employer then reimburses the agent for such claims, plus an administration fee. The employee's contract of employment requires the employer to reimburse the plan or insurance company for proper claims paid and a contract exists between the plan, or insurance company, and the employee for payment of claims for the defined risks. If the risks covered by the plan are those set out in 118.2(2), the plan will qualify as a <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr>. </li>

<h4>Insured plan (plan is backed by a contract of insurance)</h4>
<p>An insured plan meets the "all or substantially all" (generally 90% or more) requirement if all or substantially all of the <strong>premiums </strong>paid in the calendar year relate to medical expenses that are eligible for the METC.</p>
<p>The <strong>benefits </strong>paid to employees in the calendar year are not considered in determining whether the plan meets the "all or substantially all" requirement.</p>
<p>The following example explains when the "all or substantially all" requirement will be met for an insured plan.</p>

<p>This plan meets the "all or substantially all" requirement because 92% (70% + 10% + 12%) of the premiums paid relate to medical expenses that are eligible for the METC, while 8% of the premiums relate to other medical expenses. The fact that only 87% (69% + 11% + 7%) of the total benefits paid relate to medical expenses that are eligible for the METC is not relevant in determining whether the plan qualifies as a <abbr title="Private health services plan">PHSP</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Self-insured plan (plan is not backed by a contract of insurance)</h4>
<p>When a plan is not backed by a contract of insurance, the CRA considers it to be a self-insured plan.</p>
<p>A self-insured plan meets the "all or substantially all" (generally 90% or more) requirement for a calendar year if all or substantially all of the <strong>benefits paid </strong>to <strong>all employees </strong>that year are for medical expenses that are eligible for the METC.</p>
<p>The following example explains when the "all or substantially all" requirement will be met for a self-insured plan.</p>

<p>This plan meets the "all or substantially all" requirement because the benefits paid to <strong>all employees </strong>in the year for medical expenses that are eligible for the METC represent 93% ($9,000 + $3,000 + $800) of the total benefits ($13,800) paid.</p>
</details>
<p>If you provide benefits through a self-insured plan that consists of health care spending accounts (HCSAs), the method for determining whether the plan satisfies the "all or substantially all" requirement for a particular calendar year is the same as for self-insured plans that do not consist of a HCSA. The employees' allocation of the ceiling amount to the various types of expense in an HCSA is not considered.</p>
<p>Most employers that offer HCSAs do so under one group plan. However, in rare circumstances, each HCSA can be considered a separate insurance plan. The determination of whether one group plan or several individual plans exist must be based on the law and the facts of the case. For more information on HCSAs, see paragraphs 14 to 18 of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it529/archived-flexible-employee-benefit-programs.html">Interpretation Bulletin IT-529, Flexible Employee Benefit Programs</a>.</p>
<p>The following example explains when self-insured HCSAs would meet the "all or substantially all" requirement.</p>

<details><summary>Example - Health care spending accounts</summary>
<p>Company BBB provides one self-insured group plan that consists of three HCSAs, each with a $5,000 ceiling amount.  At the start of the calendar year, each employee allocates the $5,000 ceiling, as shown in the table below.</p>

<p>The plan shown above meets the "all or substantially all" requirement. The total benefits paid to all employees that year for expenses that are eligible for the METC are 92% ($11,500) of the total benefits paid ($12,525). The fact that the total ceiling amounts allocated for expenses that are eligible for the METC ($12,000) are only 80% of the total ceiling amount, eligible and non-eligible ($15,000), is not relevant in determining whether the plan meets the all or substantially all requirement.</p>
<p>However, if each HCSA is determined to be a separate plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ann's plan satisfies the all or substantially all requirement because the benefits she received for expenses that are eligible for the METC are 95% ($4,000) of the total benefits ($4,200) that she received in the year. </li>
<li>Sue's plan does not satisfy the all or substantially all requirement because the benefits she received for expenses that are eligible for the METC are only 83% ($3,250) of the total benefits ($3,900) she received in the year. </li>
<li>Jim's plan satisfies the all or substantially all requirement because the benefits he received for expenses that are eligible for the METC are 96% ($4,250) of the total benefits ($4,425) he received in the year. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Multiple plans</h4>
<p>Whether one or multiple plans exist is a question of fact and law. Multiple plans cannot be combined in determining if the "all or substantially all" requirement has been satisfied.</p>
