  <h2 id="h-0">When to fill out the TD1 forms</h2>
  <p>Employers and payers must get the completed TD1 forms from the individual:</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
    <li class="cnjnctn-col">When the employee starts work</li>
    <li class="cnjnctn-col"><strong>Within 7 days</strong> of a change to the individual's situation that may reasonably be expected to result in a change to the individual's personal tax credits for the year</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Individuals <strong>do not</strong> have to fill out a new TD1 every year unless there is a change to their federal, provincial or territorial personal tax credit amounts.</p>

  <h2 id="h-1a">When the employee has multiple employers</h2>
  <p>If an employee has more than one employer or payer at the same time and has already claimed personal tax credit amounts on another TD1 form, the employee <strong>cannot claim them again</strong>. If the employee’s total income from all sources will be <strong>more</strong> than the personal tax credits claimed on another TD1 form, they must check the box “More than one employer or payer at the same time” on page 2 of the TD1 form, enter “0” on line 13 on page 1 and not fill in lines 2 to 12. </p>

    <summary>Form TD1X: To be filled out by employees that are paid by commission </summary>
    <p>In addition to the federal TD1 form, employees paid by commissions or a combination of commissions and salary or wages, and who claim expenses can elect to file Form TD1X, Statement of Commission Income and Expenses for Payroll Tax Deductions, to take into consideration the commission expenses in the calculation of their income tax. </p>
    <h3>How to elect to use the TD1X</h3>
    <p>To elect, employees (except employees in Quebec) must fill out the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/td1x.html">TD1X, Statement of Commission Income and Expenses for Payroll Tax Deductions</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="h_0_1">How to fill out and send the TD1X</h3>
    <p>When filling out the TD1X, the employee will estimate their income and expenses by using <strong>one</strong> of the following:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm mrgn-bttm-lg">
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">The current year's estimated income and commissions expenses amounts </li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">The previous year’s income and commissions expenses amounts, if employees were paid by commission at any time that year </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The employee must give the TD1X to the employer no later than, one of the following:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">One month of the date their employment starts </li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">January 31 if with the same employer as the previous year </li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">One month after the date on which a change occurs that may reasonably be expected to result in a change to the individual's estimated deductions for the year </li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">One month after the date on which a change occurs that may reasonably be expected to result in a substantial change in the employee’s estimated total remuneration or estimated commission expenses for the year </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to revoke the TD1X</h3>
    <p>The employee can revoke the TD1X at any time during the year by notifying their employer in writing. Once revoked, the employer will deduct tax using the total claim amount on the <strong>TD1</strong>. </p>

  <h2 id="h-2">Electronic or paper TD1 forms</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>Electronic TD1 forms you created</summary>
    <p>You may create a federal and a provincial or territorial Form TD1, Personal Tax Credits Return, and have the individual send it to you electronically instead of giving paper copies of Form TD1 to the individual. The forms can be maintained and stored electronically, however security measures must be in place to authenticate the individual's identity because there is no written signature on the TD1 Form (for example, a password system or an individual self-service portal).</p>
    <p>In addition to the above condition, the electronic forms must:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
      <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Be made available and accessible to the CRA when requested and be maintained in a format that can be read by representatives of the CRA</li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Mirror the CRA approved TD1 paper form </li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Include a certification confirming that the information given by the individual is accurate (for example, clicking on a button saying "I agree" to a statement that is similar to the certification statement on the paper Form TD1 return (i.e. the information is correct and complete to the best of his or her knowledge)) </li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Be in a format that cannot be altered, meaning that changes can only be made if the individual submits a new Form TD1. </li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Include a date so you can tell when the individual submits a new Form TD1 to you </li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Meet all of the CRA's general guidelines on record retention and on electronic records, which can be found in information circular <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic78-10.html">IC78-10R, Books and Records Retention/Destruction</a> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The use of the electronic form will not relieve you of your responsibility to review the completed forms for reasonableness. </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Online or paper TD1 forms</summary>
    <p>You can give the link to the webpage or give paper copies of the appropriate TD1 forms to the individual. </p>
  </details>
  <h2 id="h-4">What if you do not receive the TD1 forms</h2>
  <p>If an individual does not give the completed TD1 form, the individual's tax deductions will only include the basic personal amount you estimated based on their income. You still need to:</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
    <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Determine which tax tables to use </li>
    <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Calculate deductions and remit them by the due date </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Penalties</h3>
  <p>If the individual <strong>does not</strong> provide you with the TD1 form when required, they are liable to a penalty of $25 for each day the form is late. The minimum penalty is $100, and increases by $25 per day to a maximum of $2,500.</p>
  <h2 id="h-5">After receiving the TD1 forms</h2>
  <p>You need to:</p>
  <ol class="lst-stps">
    <li>Review the back of the TD1 form to make sure the individual has not included any <strong>additional </strong>information (for example, requesting additional tax to be deducted). </li>
    <li>Use the <strong>Total Claim Amount </strong>from the TD1 form to calculate the correct amount of federal and provincial or territorial income tax deductions. </li>
    <li>Keep the completed forms with the individual's records. <strong>Do not </strong>send the CRA a copy. </li>
    <li>Determine which tax tables to use. </li>
    <li>Calculate deductions and remit them by the due date. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>A new form will be required within <strong>7 days </strong>of any changes to the individual's personal tax credits. </p>

  <h3>Your responsibility</h3>
  <p>It is a serious offence to knowingly accept a TD1 that contains false or deceptive statements. If you think that the TD1 has false information, you must deduct taxes after allowing the basic personal amount <strong>only</strong>.</p>
