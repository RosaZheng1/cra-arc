<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Payroll examinations and account reviews</h1>


 <div class="row">
 <div class="col-md-6">
<p>The purpose of the payroll examinations and account reviews is to maintain the integrity of the tax system with respect to all of the following:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The <strong>reporting</strong> of employment income and taxable benefits</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The <strong>withholding and remitting</strong> of payroll related amounts</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The proper <strong>characterization of workers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>They are completed through a combination of taxpayer education and responsible enforcement. </p>

<details><summary>Why are examinations and reviews important</strong></summary> 
<p>The examinations and reviews promotes employer awareness and understanding of tax laws and obligations as provided in the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Employment Insurance Act, and their respective regulations, to increase and enhance voluntary compliance.</p>

<p>Under the Canada Pension Plan and the Employment Insurance Act, the CRA is responsible for determining:</p>
<ul >
<li >Whether or not an individual's employment is pensionable under the Canada Pension Plan and/or insurable under the Employment Insurance Act </li>
<li >The amount of pensionable and/or insurable earnings </li>
<li >Whether or not Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions and employment insurance (EI) premiums are payable </li>
<li >How many hours an insured person has in insurable employment </li>
<li >How long an employment lasts, including the dates on which the employment began and ended </li>
<li >The amount of CPP contributions and/or EI premiums payable </li>
<li >Who is the employer </li>
<li >Whether or not employers are considered to be associated for the purposes of the Employment Insurance Act </li>
 The refund amount </li>
</ul>
<p>The CRA is also responsible for ensuring that CPP contributions and EI premiums are deducted, remitted, and reported as required by legislation.</p>

<h2 >Process of the review</h2>
 <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">

<li><details open><summary><span class="fas fa-envelope-open-text fa-xl mrgn-rght-sm"></span> <span class="h3">Your account is selected for review</span></summary> 
<p id="step1">The CRA will send you an initial contact letter to inform you (as the employer) that your payroll account has been selected for review to make sure you meet your payroll obligations. This review helps confirm that income amounts, deductions, and credits are reported correctly and can be properly supported.</p>

<p>The letter will provide you with the purpose of the review and the timeframe for the next CRA contact.</p>
<p>The letter includes the name of the CRA officer assigned to the case. </p>

<h4><span class="fa-stack text-muted mrgn-lft-0 mrgn-rght-sm"><i class="far fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fas fa-hands-helping fa-stack-1x"></i></span> Authorized reprensentative prepared your information returns</h4>
<p>Even if a professional tax preparer may have completed your payrol information returns (for example, T4 slips and T4 summary) on your behalf, you are responsible for making sure your business meets all their payroll tax obligations. Generally, tax preparers will use the information you give them to prepare your remittance amounts and information returns, but they may not be aware of all your tax obligations. This is why the CRA may contact you directly for the review.</p>

 <p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md text-right"><span class="far fa-clock mrgn-rght-sm"></span><strong>Next CRA contact:</strong> Within 4 weeks</p>
</details></li>

<li><details><summary><span class="h3">Your appointment confirmation with the CRA</span></summary> 
<p>A CRA officer will usually contact you by phone to begin the review process. The officer will also send you a second letter confirming the date and the time to review your books and records. If an in-person examination is required, we will also provide you the address for this review. </p>

<p>Once you are satisfied regarding the identity of the CRA officer, the CRA recommends that you answer the officers’s questions to the best of your ability. Collaborating with the officer will lead to a smooth and efficient review.</p>

<h4>Confirm a phone number is from the CRA</h4>
<p>You may not be comfortable speaking to the officer until you have confirmed that they are from the CRA. In that case, you may end the call, and then return the call from the officer assigned to the case. You can also wait until you receive the review appointment confirmation letter before providing additional information.</p>
 <p>Do not verify the phone number during the call or rely on the number displayed on your caller ID. End the call and verify the callback number to confirm if a phone number is from the CRA.</p>

<h4>Where the review happens</h4>
<p>Normally, the officer will work at the place of business. </p>
<p>Occasionally, the officer will borrow documents to complete the review at a CRA office or an alternate location, such as your accountant’s office. The officer will make arrangements to speak with you to discuss any questions that arise during the review.</p>

 <p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md text-right"><span class="far fa-clock mrgn-rght-sm"></span><strong>Next CRA contact:</strong> Within 6 weeks</p>
</details></li>

<li><details><summary><span class="h3">Sending your documents for the review</span></summary>
<p>The second contact letter will request specific payroll documents, including the deadline (generally 30 days) to submit your documents. </p>

 <p>You can send your documents using the following methods: </p>

<p><span class="fa-stack text-muted fa-lg mrgn-lft-sm mrgn-rght-sm"><i class="far fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fas fa-user-cog fa-stack-1x"></i></span> canada.ca/my-cra-business-account, if you are a business owner</p>

<h4>How to provide your documents</h4>
<p>If your books and records are available electronically, the officer will normally ask for your electronic records before meeting with you. This usually speeds up the review process and leads to less time spent at your place of business.</p>
<p>If electronic records are not available, or physical records are required, the officer will either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the documents at your place of business or representative’s office</li>
<li>Borrow the documents that are required for further review. In this case, the officer will provide you with a detailed receipt for any borrowed documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also deliver your supporting documents to a CRA <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">tax services office</a>, send them by mail, or submit them online using the CRA’s secure online services. For information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/submit-documents-online.html">submit documents online</a>.</p>
<p>For security reasons, officer cannot receive files by email.</p>

<details><summary>Info Brigitte found from non-filer program</summary>
<p>Someone can be considered a non-filer for various reasons. These include:
</p><ul>
    <li>not realizing they needed to file</li>
    <li>forgetting to file</li>
    <li>intentionally not filing their taxes</li>
</ul>


        <h3 id="toc2">The non-filer process</h3>
        <p>The non-filer process starts after the filing deadline has passed. If we identify an unfiled tax return with
            potential taxes owing, we will assign the file to the NFP, who will begin to take a series of escalating
            enforcement actions to obtain the outstanding return(s).</p>
        <h4 id="toc3">Initial contact</h4>
        <p>You may receive a letter or notice from the NFP, asking you to file your outstanding tax return(s). Once this
            happens, you are legally required to file the return(s) under <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-146.html#308937">subsection 150(2) of the
                ITA</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="toc4">What if we phone you</h4>
        <p>An officer from the NFP may call you to get more information about your tax situation. They will explain the
            enforcement process and provide you with a deadline to file your outstanding return(s).</p>
 
       <h3 id="toc5">What happens if attempts to contact you have been unsuccessful</h3>
        <p>If we cannot contact you by phone or mail, an authorized officer from the NFP may visit you at your home,
            your place of work, or your business. This can happen if we need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>confirm your location</li>
            <li>obtain outstanding returns</li>
            <li>pick up or deliver documents</li>
            <li>educate you about your filing requirements and compliance</li>
            <li>serve you a Notice of Requirement or a Requirement for Information letter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the case of a business, we may need to get, or confirm, information, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>books and records</li>
            <li>income, accounts receivable, and expenses</li>
            <li>business or professional activities and operational status</li>
        </ul>
        <p>According to <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-194.html#docCont">section 231.1(1)
                of the ITA</a>, you are required to provide the necessary documents and information that an NFP officer
            asks for. It is important to respond promptly and truthfully to any requests from the CRA during a visit to
            avoid potential penalties or legal consequences.</p>

                <summary id="toc6">How to identify an authorized individual from the CRA</summary>
        <p><strong>In person</strong></p>
        <p>The authorized officer will carry a CRA Authorization Card (RC121A) to prove that they are a representative
            of the CRA. The CRA Authorization Card includes the employee's name and badge number. It is the primary
            method of employee identification. If you are unsure about the legitimacy of a visit from a CRA officer, you
            can <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html">contact the CRA</a>
            and ask an agent to confirm the officer's identity.</p>
        <p><strong>Phone call</strong></p>
        <p>A legitimate CRA employee will identify themselves when they contact you by phone, providing you with their
            name and phone number so you can call them back if needed.</p>
        <p>If you doubt a caller's identity, ensure the caller is a CRA employee <strong>before</strong>&nbsp;providing
            any information over the phone.</p>

        <h3 id="toc7">Tax assessment</h3>
        <p>If you are required by law to file a tax return but do not do so, we may assess you tax owing as per <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-147.html#h-308992">subsection 152(7) of the
                ITA</a>. Through this process, we won't include voluntary deductions you may have been eligible for, as deductions are dependent on facts we may not have access to. For business expenses, we'll estimate an average amount using previous tax filings as a
            guideline.</p>
        <p>If you decide to do your taxes for a year we have already assessed under <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-147.html#h-308992">subsection 152(7) of the
                ITA</a>, we'll <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/review-your-tax-return-cra.html">review
                your tax return</a> to verify the accuracy of the income you reported and the deductions you claimed and we will issue you a notice of reassessment.
        </p>
        <h3 id="toc8">Penalties and interest</h3>
        <p>You have to submit your personal, business and trust tax returns by the filing deadline when you have tax
            owing.</p>
        <p>You will be subject to a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/interest-penalties/late-filing-penalty.html">late
                filing penalty</a> if you miss your filing deadline and owe taxes. If you're late again within three
            years and we issued a formal demand for a return, we will charge you a repeat late filing penalty under <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-153.html#h-309807:~:text=Repeated%20failure%20to,return%20was%20filed">section 162(2) of the ITA</a>. Under
            specific circumstances, an information return penalty under <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-153.html#h-309807">section 162(1) of the ITA</a> may also apply.</p>
        <p>We'll calculate interest based on the amount you owe and penalties assessed.</p>
        <p>When events beyond your control prevent you from meeting your tax obligations, you may be eligible for relief from the penalties and interest assessed.

                or waive penalties and interest</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="toc9">Prosecution</h3>

        <p>If all attempts to obtain compliance with the filing of your income tax returns have failed, the NFP may consider an enforcement action called a prosecution. This involves legal proceedings and the courts. If convicted of an offence, prosecuted taxpayers may face a fine, jail sentence or, a combination of the two.</p>

        <p>Prosecutions fall under federal jurisdiction, and are instituted in accordance with the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-3.3/">Income Tax Act</a>.</p>

</details>
 <details><summary>Info Brigitte found from business audit</summary>

<h3 id="toc9"><a id="toc9"></a>If you disagree</h3>
<p>If you disagree with the adjustments proposed by the auditor, you are encouraged to contact the auditor to try and resolve disagreements. If issues remain unresolved, you can contact the auditor’s team leader to discuss them further.</p>
<p>In cases where changes are made to your taxable income or taxes payable, you will receive a Notice of Reassessment. If changes are made to a loss you claimed, you will receive a Notice of Redetermination.</p>
<p>If you want to dispute your reassessment, you have the right to object. When you file an objection, you have to explain why you disagree and include all relevant facts and supporting documents. Once the CRA makes a decision on your objection, you must pay any remaining amounts you owe, including taxes, penalties, and interest. Note that, in most cases, interest charges still apply to an amount owing while it is in dispute.</p>

<p>The time it takes to complete a payroll examination review varies.</p>
<p>There may be delays if you cannot provide books and records as requested. If you no longer have certain records, speak with the officer assigned to your case to find alternate methods to confirm the amounts reported on the information returns.</p>
<p>There may also be delays caused by the CRA. For example, the officer may need to consult other CRA tax specialists or the officer may be absent for personal reasons. In some cases, it may also be necessary for the CRA to assign a new officer to the payroll examination review.</p>
