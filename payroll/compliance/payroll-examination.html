<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Payroll examinations and account reviews</h1>


 <div class="row">
 <div class="col-md-6">
<p>The purpose of the payroll examinations and account reviews is to maintain the integrity of the tax system with respect to all of the following:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The <strong>reporting</strong> of employment income and taxable benefits</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The <strong>withholding and remitting</strong> of payroll related amounts</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The proper <strong>characterization of workers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>They are completed through a combination of taxpayer education and responsible enforcement. </p>

<details><summary>Why are examinations and reviews important</strong></summary> 
<p>The examinations and reviews promotes employer awareness and understanding of tax laws and obligations as provided in the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Employment Insurance Act, and their respective regulations, to increase and enhance voluntary compliance.</p>

<p>Under the Canada Pension Plan and the Employment Insurance Act, the CRA is responsible for determining:</p>
<ul >
<li >Whether or not an individual's employment is pensionable under the Canada Pension Plan and/or insurable under the Employment Insurance Act </li>
<li >The amount of pensionable and/or insurable earnings </li>
<li >Whether or not Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions and employment insurance (EI) premiums are payable </li>
<li >How many hours an insured person has in insurable employment </li>
<li >How long an employment lasts, including the dates on which the employment began and ended </li>
<li >The amount of CPP contributions and/or EI premiums payable </li>
<li >Who is the employer </li>
<li >Whether or not employers are considered to be associated for the purposes of the Employment Insurance Act </li>
 The refund amount </li>
</ul>
<p>The CRA is also responsible for ensuring that CPP contributions and EI premiums are deducted, remitted, and reported as required by legislation.</p>

<h2 >Process of the review</h2>
 <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">

<li><details open><summary><span class="fas fa-envelope-open-text fa-xl mrgn-rght-sm"></span> <span class="h3">Your account is selected for review</span></summary> 
<p id="step1">The CRA will send you an initial contact letter to inform you (as the employer) that your payroll account has been selected for review to make sure you meet your payroll obligations. This review helps confirm that income amounts, deductions, and credits are reported correctly and can be properly supported.</p>

<p>The letter will provide you with the purpose of the review and the timeframe for the next CRA contact.</p>
<p>The letter includes the name of the CRA officer assigned to the case. </p>

<details><summary>What if your authorized reprensentative prepared your information returns</summary>
<p>Even if a professional tax preparer may have completed your payrol information returns (for example, T4 slips and T4 summary) on your behalf, you are responsible for making sure your business meets all their payroll tax obligations. Generally, tax preparers will use the information you give them to prepare your remittance amounts and information returns, but they may not be aware of all your tax obligations. This is why the CRA may contact you directly for the review.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Your rights during an review</summary>
<p>The CRA operates on the fundamental belief that you are more likely to comply with the law if you have the information and other services that you need to meet your obligations.</p>
<p>The CRA wants to make sure you receive all of your entitlements and that you understand and can exercise your rights.</p>

</details></li>

<li><details><summary><span class="h3">Your appointment confirmation with the CRA</span></summary> 
<p>A CRA officer will usually contact you by phone to begin the review process. The officer will also send you a second letter confirming the date and the time to review your books and records. If an in-person examination is required, we will also provide you the address for this review. </p>

<p>Normally, the officer will work at the place of business. Occasionally, the officer will borrow documents to complete the review at a CRA office or an alternate location, such as your accountant’s office. The officer will make arrangements to speak with you to discuss any questions that arise during the review.</p>

 <h3>Verify the identity of the CRA officer</h3>

<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li >
<details><summary><span class="fas fa-people-arrows fa-xl mrgn-rght-sm"></span> <span class="h4">In-person - Confirm if the CRA authorization card</span></summary> 
      
      <p>The authorized officer will carry a CRA authorization card (RC121A) to prove that they are a representative of the CRA. The CRA authorization card includes the employee's name and badge number. It is the primary method of employee identification. </p>
<p>If you are unsure about the legitimacy of a visit from a CRA officer, you can contact the CRA and ask an agent to confirm the officer's identity.</p>

        <p>The CRA officer assigned to your case will identify themselves when they contact you by phone, providing you with their name and phone number so you can call them back if needed.</p>
	        <p>If you doubt a caller's identity, ensure the caller is a CRA employee <strong>before</strong> providing any information over the phone. You can also wait until you receive the review appointment confirmation letter before providing additional information.</p>

        <p>Do not verify the phone number during the call or rely on the number displayed on your caller ID. End the call and verify the callback number to confirm if a phone number is from the CRA.</p>

 <h3>Collaborating with the CRA officer assigned to your case</h3>
<p>Once you are satisfied regarding the identity of the CRA officer, the CRA recommends that you answer the officers’s questions to the best of your ability. Collaborating with the officer will lead to a smooth and efficient review.</p>

<li><details><summary><span class="h3">Sending your documents for the review</span></summary>
<p>The second contact letter will request specific payroll documents, including the deadline (generally 30 days) to submit your documents. Once you receive this request, you are legally required to provide the requested books and records for this review.</p>

 <p>You can send your documents using the following methods: </p>

<h4>How to provide your documents</h4>
<p>If your books and records are available electronically, the officer will normally ask for your electronic records before meeting with you. This usually speeds up the review process and leads to less time spent at your place of business.</p>
<p>If electronic records are not available, or physical records are required, the officer will either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the documents at your place of business or representative’s office</li>
<li>Borrow the documents that are required for further review. In this case, the officer will provide you with a detailed receipt for any borrowed documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also deliver your supporting documents to a CRA <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">tax services office</a>, send them by mail, or submit them online using the CRA’s secure online services. For information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/submit-documents-online.html">submit documents online</a>.</p>

<p>You may agree or disagree with the proposed results. If you disagree with the changes proposed by the officer, you are encouraged to contact the officer to try and resolve disagreements. If issues remain unresolved, you can contact the officer’s team leader to discuss further.</p>

<li> <details><summary><span class="h3">Follow-up review notice </span></summary>
<p>If the CRA determines that further review is necessary, you may receive a notice of a follow-up review. This letter will outline the scope of the next review and the records you need to prepare for the next stage of second review.</p>

 <p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md text-right"><span class="far fa-clock mrgn-rght-sm"></span><strong>Follow up:</strong> Varies depending on the case</p>
</details> </li>

<li> <details><summary><span class="h3">Your right to appeal if you disagree</span></summary>
<p>If you want to dispute your reassessment, you have the right to object. When you file an objection, you have to explain why you disagree and include all relevant facts and supporting documents. Once the CRA makes a decision on your objection, you must pay any remaining amounts you owe, including taxes, penalties, and interest. Note that, in most cases, interest charges still apply to an amount owing while it is in dispute.</p>

<p>If you disagree with the CRA's review, you will be sent a formal letter regarding your right to appeal. This letter will outline the process for filing a Notice of Objection or appealing the reassessment to the Tax Court of Canada.</p>
