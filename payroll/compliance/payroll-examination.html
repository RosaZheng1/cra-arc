 <div class="row">
 <div class="col-md-6">
<p>The purpose of the payroll examinations and account reviews is to maintain the integrity of the tax system with respect to all of the following:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The reporting of employment income and taxable benefits</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The withholding and remitting of payroll related amounts</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The proper characterization of workers</li>
</ul>
<p>They are completed through a combination of taxpayer education and responsible enforcement. </p>

<details><summary>Why are examinations and reviews important</strong></summary> 
<p>The examinations and reviews promotes employer awareness and understanding of tax laws and obligations as provided in the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Employment Insurance Act, and their respective regulations, to increase and enhance voluntary compliance.</p>

<p>Under the Canada Pension Plan and the Employment Insurance Act, the CRA is responsible for determining:</p>
<ul >
<li >Whether or not an individual's employment is pensionable under the Canada Pension Plan and/or insurable under the Employment Insurance Act </li>
<li >The amount of pensionable and/or insurable earnings </li>
<li >Whether or not Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions and employment insurance (EI) premiums are payable </li>
<li >How many hours an insured person has in insurable employment </li>
<li >How long an employment lasts, including the dates on which the employment began and ended </li>
<li >The amount of CPP contributions and/or EI premiums payable </li>
<li >Who is the employer </li>
<li >Whether or not employers are considered to be associated for the purposes of the Employment Insurance Act </li>
 The refund amount </li>
</ul>
<p>The CRA is also responsible for ensuring that CPP contributions and EI premiums are deducted, remitted, and reported as required by legislation.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
 <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">

<li><details open><summary>Determine the purpose of the review and the reason your payroll account is selected</summary> 
<p id="step1">The CRA’s risk-assessment systems identify accounts that are considered to be at high risk for non-compliance. When an account is identified as high-risk, a CRA officer will review information from various sources to determine whether an examination or account review is needed to address the risks identified. For example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>You made an error in calculating deductions or you did not withhold deductions <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/calculating-deductions/making-deductions.html">Get ready to make deductions</a></li>
    <li>Determined that they have taxes owing.</li>
</ol>
<details><summary>Info Brigitte found from non-filer program</summary>
<p>Someone can be considered a non-filer for various reasons. These include:
</p><ul>
    <li>not realizing they needed to file</li>
    <li>forgetting to file</li>
    <li>intentionally not filing their taxes</li>
</ul>


        <h3 id="toc2">The non-filer process</h3>
        <p>The non-filer process starts after the filing deadline has passed. If we identify an unfiled tax return with
            potential taxes owing, we will assign the file to the NFP, who will begin to take a series of escalating
            enforcement actions to obtain the outstanding return(s).</p>
        <h4 id="toc3">Initial contact</h4>
        <p>You may receive a letter or notice from the NFP, asking you to file your outstanding tax return(s). Once this
            happens, you are legally required to file the return(s) under <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-146.html#308937">subsection 150(2) of the
                ITA</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="toc4">What if we phone you</h4>
        <p>An officer from the NFP may call you to get more information about your tax situation. They will explain the
            enforcement process and provide you with a deadline to file your outstanding return(s).</p>
 
       <h3 id="toc5">What happens if attempts to contact you have been unsuccessful</h3>
        <p>If we cannot contact you by phone or mail, an authorized officer from the NFP may visit you at your home,
            your place of work, or your business. This can happen if we need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>confirm your location</li>
            <li>obtain outstanding returns</li>
            <li>pick up or deliver documents</li>
            <li>educate you about your filing requirements and compliance</li>
            <li>serve you a Notice of Requirement or a Requirement for Information letter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the case of a business, we may need to get, or confirm, information, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>books and records</li>
            <li>income, accounts receivable, and expenses</li>
            <li>business or professional activities and operational status</li>
        </ul>
        <p>According to <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-194.html#docCont">section 231.1(1)
                of the ITA</a>, you are required to provide the necessary documents and information that an NFP officer
            asks for. It is important to respond promptly and truthfully to any requests from the CRA during a visit to
            avoid potential penalties or legal consequences.</p>

        <p><strong>In person</strong></p>
        <p>The authorized officer will carry a CRA Authorization Card (RC121A) to prove that they are a representative
            of the CRA. The CRA Authorization Card includes the employee's name and badge number. It is the primary
            method of employee identification. If you are unsure about the legitimacy of a visit from a CRA officer, you
            can <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html">contact the CRA</a>
            and ask an agent to confirm the officer's identity.</p>
        <p><strong>Phone call</strong></p>
        <p>A legitimate CRA employee will identify themselves when they contact you by phone, providing you with their
            name and phone number so you can call them back if needed.</p>
        <p>If you doubt a caller's identity, ensure the caller is a CRA employee <strong>before</strong>&nbsp;providing
            any information over the phone.</p>

        <h3 id="toc7">Tax assessment</h3>
        <p>If you are required by law to file a tax return but do not do so, we may assess you tax owing as per <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-147.html#h-308992">subsection 152(7) of the
                ITA</a>. Through this process, we won't include voluntary deductions you may have been eligible for, as deductions are dependent on facts we may not have access to. For business expenses, we'll estimate an average amount using previous tax filings as a
            guideline.</p>
        <p>If you decide to do your taxes for a year we have already assessed under <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-147.html#h-308992">subsection 152(7) of the
                ITA</a>, we'll <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/review-your-tax-return-cra.html">review
                your tax return</a> to verify the accuracy of the income you reported and the deductions you claimed and we will issue you a notice of reassessment.
        </p>
        <h3 id="toc8">Penalties and interest</h3>
        <p>You have to submit your personal, business and trust tax returns by the filing deadline when you have tax
            owing.</p>
        <p>You will be subject to a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/interest-penalties/late-filing-penalty.html">late
                filing penalty</a> if you miss your filing deadline and owe taxes. If you're late again within three
            years and we issued a formal demand for a return, we will charge you a repeat late filing penalty under <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-153.html#h-309807:~:text=Repeated%20failure%20to,return%20was%20filed">section 162(2) of the ITA</a>. Under

        <p>We'll calculate interest based on the amount you owe and penalties assessed.</p>
        <p>When events beyond your control prevent you from meeting your tax obligations, you may be eligible for relief from the penalties and interest assessed.

        <h3 id="toc9">Prosecution</h3>

        <p>If all attempts to obtain compliance with the filing of your income tax returns have failed, the NFP may consider an enforcement action called a prosecution. This involves legal proceedings and the courts. If convicted of an offence, prosecuted taxpayers may face a fine, jail sentence or, a combination of the two.</p>

        <p>Prosecutions fall under federal jurisdiction, and are instituted in accordance with the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-3.3/">Income Tax Act</a>.</p>

 <details><summary>Info Brigitte found from business audit</summary>
      <h3 id="toc0"><a id="toc0"></a>How the CRA selects a file for audit</h3>
<p>The CRA’s risk-assessment systems identify tax returns that are considered to be at high risk for non-compliance. When a return is identified as high-risk, a CRA officer will review information from various sources to determine whether an audit is needed to address the risks identified.</p>
<h3 id="toc1"><a id="toc1"></a>How the CRA will contact you</h3>
<p>A CRA auditor will usually contact you by phone to begin the audit process. The auditor will also send you a letter confirming details of the audit.</p>
<p>You may not be comfortable speaking to the auditor until you have confirmed that they are from the CRA. In that case, you may end the call, and then call the auditor or the team leader back. You can also wait until you receive the audit confirmation letter before providing additional information.</p>
<p>Once you are satisfied regarding the identity of the auditor, it is recommended that you answer the auditor’s questions to the best of your ability and, when required, provide the auditor access to the place of business and books and records. Collaborating with the auditor will lead to a smooth and efficient audit.</p>
<h3 id="toc2"><a id="toc2"></a>Where the audit happens</h3>
<p>Normally, the auditor will work at the place of business.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the auditor will borrow documents to complete the audit at a CRA office or an alternate location, such as your accountant’s office. The auditor will make arrangements to speak with you to discuss any questions that arise during the audit.</p>
<h3 id="toc3"><a id="toc3"></a>Documents that are required</h3>
<p>During the audit, the auditor will look at various documents, which may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the business records (such as ledgers, journals, invoices, receipts, contracts, and bank statements);</li>
<li>the personal records of the business owner(s) (such as bank statements for personal accounts, mortgage documents, and credit card statements); and</li>
<li>the personal or business records of other individuals or <a href="#toc6">entities related</a> to the business owner(s) (such as a spouse, family members, corporations, partnerships, or a trust).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these documents, the CRA may ask for input from your accountant, book-keeper, and/or employees, about information that relates to the books and records and what was reported in the tax returns.</p>
<h3 id="toc4"><a id="toc4"></a>How to provide your documents</h3>
<p>If your books and records are available electronically, the auditor will normally ask for your electronic records before meeting with you. This usually speeds up the audit process and leads to less time spent at your place of business.</p>
<p>If electronic records are not available, or physical records are required, the auditor will either:</p>
<ul>
<li>review the documents at your place of business or representative’s office; or</li>
<li>borrow the documents that are required for further review. In this case, the auditor will provide you with a detailed receipt for any borrowed documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also deliver your supporting documents to a CRA <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">tax services office</a>, send them by mail, or submit them online using the CRA’s secure online services. For information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/submit-documents-online.html">submit documents online</a>.</p>
<p>For security reasons, auditors cannot receive files by email.</p>
<h3 id="toc5"><a id="toc5"></a>Information about indirect verification of income</h3>
<p>The CRA often uses alternative methods to ensure that the income reported by the business is correct. This is referred to as "indirect verification of income".</p>
<p>The CRA will generally use an indirect verification of income method when there are indications of one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The books and records are prone to error. This can be the case when one person does most of the accounting, or when the main functions in a business are done by one person or by a small group of related persons.</li>
<li>The business and personal bank accounts may have been used interchangeably.</li>
<li>The taxpayer’s lifestyle does not seem to match the income reported to the CRA.</li>
<li>The business is in a sector that is considered to be at high risk for unreported income.</li>
<li>The business consistently reports income lower than other similar businesses in the same sector.</li>
</ul>
<p>In preparing for an indirect verification of income, the CRA will work with the business and its owner(s) (and any representative chosen by the business) to make sure that all relevant information is considered when determining the accuracy of reported income.</p>
<p>The net worth method is the most common method of indirect verification of income used by the CRA. When the net worth method is used, the auditor considers changes in assets and liabilities, personal spending, and other relevant information, such as non-taxable sources of income (including gifts, inheritances, and lottery winnings). The income according to the net worth calculation is then compared to the information reported on the business owner’s tax return to make sure that all income has been reported accurately.</p>
<p>The net worth method goes beyond the books and records of the business and involves a comprehensive review of the business owner’s lifestyle using their personal financial records and other verifiable information, such as motor vehicle registration information and land title information.</p>
<p>In cases where the CRA uses the net worth method, it is important that the CRA have a complete financial picture of the business owner’s family unit. Therefore, in addition to reviewing the business owner’s personal financial records, the CRA will ask for the personal financial records of the business owner’s spouse, as well as any other contributing member of the household.</p>
<h3><a id="toc6"></a>Information about the economic entity audit approach&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In some cases, the CRA uses an economic entity audit approach which involves grouping related, associated, and/or otherwise connected legal entities into one group, known as an economic entity. This grouping ensures that complex business structures are reviewed in a holistic manner. The CRA looks at the risks that arise as a result of the economic entity’s structure and transactions among its members.</p>
<p>Audits of multiple members of the economic entity may occur when the group is identified to have a high risk of non-compliance.</p>
<p>Additional entities will be contacted separately where applicable.</p>
<p>The requirements for documents for an audit using the economic entity approach are the same as for a regular business audit.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="toc7"><a id="toc7"></a>How long the audit will last: avoiding delays</h3>
<p>The time it takes to complete a business audit varies.</p>
<p>There may be delays if you cannot provide records as asked. If you no longer have certain records, speak with the auditor or the auditor’s team leader to find alternate methods to confirm the amounts reported on the return(s).</p>
<p>There may also be delays caused by the CRA: for example, the auditor may need to consult other CRA tax specialists or the auditor may be absent for personal reasons. In some cases, it may also be necessary for the CRA to assign a new auditor to the business audit.</p>
<h3 id="toc8"><a id="toc8"></a>After the audit</h3>
<p>After the auditor finishes reviewing the records provided, the auditor will provide you with a written summary of the audit findings. If the auditor finds that no changes need to be made to the return(s), then nothing more has to be done and the audit will be closed.</p>
<p>If the auditor determines that changes need to be made to the tax return(s), you will have 30 days to respond to the auditor’s written summary of the audit findings. You may agree or disagree with the proposed findings.</p>
<h3 id="toc9"><a id="toc9"></a>If you disagree</h3>
<p>If you disagree with the adjustments proposed by the auditor, you are encouraged to contact the auditor to try and resolve disagreements. If issues remain unresolved, you can contact the auditor’s team leader to discuss them further.</p>
<p>In cases where changes are made to your taxable income or taxes payable, you will receive a Notice of Reassessment. If changes are made to a loss you claimed, you will receive a Notice of Redetermination.</p>
<p>If you want to dispute your reassessment, you have the right to object. When you file an objection, you have to explain why you disagree and include all relevant facts and supporting documents. Once the CRA makes a decision on your objection, you must pay any remaining amounts you owe, including taxes, penalties, and interest. Note that, in most cases, interest charges still apply to an amount owing while it is in dispute.</p>
