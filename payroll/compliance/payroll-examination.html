<h2 id="toc0-1">CRA's responsibility</h2>
<p>Under the Canada Pension Plan and the Employment Insurance Act, the CRA is responsible for determining:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Whether or not an individual's employment is pensionable under the Canada Pension Plan and/or insurable under the Employment Insurance Act </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The amount of pensionable and/or insurable earnings </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Whether or not Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions and employment insurance (EI) premiums are payable </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">How many hours an insured person has in insurable employment </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">How long an employment lasts, including the dates on which the employment began and ended </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The amount of CPP contributions and/or EI premiums payable </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Who is the employer </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Whether or not employers are considered to be associated for the purposes of the Employment Insurance Act </li>
 The refund amount </li>
</ul>
<p>The CRA is also responsible for ensuring that CPP contributions and EI premiums are deducted, remitted, and reported as required by legislation.</p>

<h2 id="toc0-2">Purpose of the payroll examinations and account reviews</h2>
<p>The purpose of the payroll examinations and account reviews is to maintain the integrity of the tax system with respect to all of the following:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The reporting of employment income and taxable benefits</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The withholding and remitting of payroll related amounts</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The proper characterization of workers</li>
</ul>
<p>They are completed through a combination of taxpayer education and responsible enforcement. </p>
<h4>Why are examinations and reviews important</h4>
<p>The examinations and reviews promotes employer awareness and understanding of tax laws and obligations as provided in the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Employment Insurance Act, and their respective regulations, to increase and enhance voluntary compliance.</p>


<div class="mwsgeneric-base-html parbase section">



    <h2 id="toc0">How your payroll account is selected for examination</h2>
<p>Through the NFP, we may select a non-filer individual, corporation, or trust for further review in certain    situations:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/you-have-file-a-return.html">Required to file their income tax returns</a>; but have not; and</li>
    <li>Determined that they have taxes owing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Someone can be considered a non-filer for various reasons. These include:
</p><ul>
    <li>not realizing they needed to file</li>
    <li>forgetting to file</li>
    <li>intentionally not filing their taxes</li>
</ul>


        <h3 id="toc2">The non-filer process</h3>
        <p>The non-filer process starts after the filing deadline has passed. If we identify an unfiled tax return with
            potential taxes owing, we will assign the file to the NFP, who will begin to take a series of escalating
            enforcement actions to obtain the outstanding return(s).</p>
        <h4 id="toc3">Initial contact</h4>
        <p>You may receive a letter or notice from the NFP, asking you to file your outstanding tax return(s). Once this
            happens, you are legally required to file the return(s) under <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-146.html#308937">subsection 150(2) of the
                ITA</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="toc4">What if we phone you</h4>
        <p>An officer from the NFP may call you to get more information about your tax situation. They will explain the
            enforcement process and provide you with a deadline to file your outstanding return(s).</p>
 
       <h3 id="toc5">What happens if attempts to contact you have been unsuccessful</h3>
        <p>If we cannot contact you by phone or mail, an authorized officer from the NFP may visit you at your home,
            your place of work, or your business. This can happen if we need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>confirm your location</li>
            <li>obtain outstanding returns</li>
            <li>pick up or deliver documents</li>
            <li>educate you about your filing requirements and compliance</li>
            <li>serve you a Notice of Requirement or a Requirement for Information letter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the case of a business, we may need to get, or confirm, information, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>books and records</li>
            <li>income, accounts receivable, and expenses</li>
            <li>business or professional activities and operational status</li>
        </ul>
        <p>According to <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-194.html#docCont">section 231.1(1)
                of the ITA</a>, you are required to provide the necessary documents and information that an NFP officer
            asks for. It is important to respond promptly and truthfully to any requests from the CRA during a visit to
            avoid potential penalties or legal consequences.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-8">
<div class="well"><p>According to <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-194.html#docCont:~:text=Records%20and%20books,to%20be%20determined.">section 230(1) of the ITA</a>, business owners are required to keep their books and records either at their place of business or residence, unless an authorized representative of the CRA designates a different place where they may be kept.</p></div>
     
            <details>
                <summary id="toc6">How to identify an authorized individual from the CRA</summary>
        <p><strong>In person</strong></p>
        <p>The authorized officer will carry a CRA Authorization Card (RC121A) to prove that they are a representative
            of the CRA. The CRA Authorization Card includes the employee's name and badge number. It is the primary
            method of employee identification. If you are unsure about the legitimacy of a visit from a CRA officer, you
            can <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html">contact the CRA</a>
            and ask an agent to confirm the officer's identity.</p>
        <p><strong>Phone call</strong></p>
        <p>A legitimate CRA employee will identify themselves when they contact you by phone, providing you with their
            name and phone number so you can call them back if needed.</p>
        <p>If you doubt a caller's identity, ensure the caller is a CRA employee <strong>before</strong>&nbsp;providing
            any information over the phone.</p>

            </div>

        <h3 id="toc7">Tax assessment</h3>
        <p>If you are required by law to file a tax return but do not do so, we may assess you tax owing as per <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-147.html#h-308992">subsection 152(7) of the
                ITA</a>. Through this process, we won't include voluntary deductions you may have been eligible for, as deductions are dependent on facts we may not have access to. For business expenses, we'll estimate an average amount using previous tax filings as a
            guideline.</p>
        <p>If you decide to do your taxes for a year we have already assessed under <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-147.html#h-308992">subsection 152(7) of the
                ITA</a>, we'll <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/review-your-tax-return-cra.html">review
                your tax return</a> to verify the accuracy of the income you reported and the deductions you claimed and we will issue you a notice of reassessment.
        </p>
        <h3 id="toc8">Penalties and interest</h3>
        <p>You have to submit your personal, business and trust tax returns by the filing deadline when you have tax
            owing.</p>
        <p>You will be subject to a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/interest-penalties/late-filing-penalty.html">late
                filing penalty</a> if you miss your filing deadline and owe taxes. If you're late again within three
            years and we issued a formal demand for a return, we will charge you a repeat late filing penalty under <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-153.html#h-309807:~:text=Repeated%20failure%20to,return%20was%20filed">section 162(2) of the ITA</a>. Under
            specific circumstances, an information return penalty under <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/page-153.html#h-309807">section 162(1) of the ITA</a> may also apply.</p>
        <p>We'll calculate interest based on the amount you owe and penalties assessed.</p>
        <p>When events beyond your control prevent you from meeting your tax obligations, you may be eligible for relief from the penalties and interest assessed. For more information, refer to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/taxpayer-relief-provisions.html#h_1">cancel
                or waive penalties and interest</a>.</p>
        <p>If you can't pay the amount of your assessment in full or on time, including any related penalties and
            interest, <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/contact-canada-revenue-agency-about-your-debt.html">contact
                our Collections department</a> to set up a payment arrangement.</p>

        <h3 id="toc9">Prosecution</h3>

        <p>If all attempts to obtain compliance with the filing of your income tax returns have failed, the NFP may consider an enforcement action called a prosecution. This involves legal proceedings and the courts. If convicted of an offence, prosecuted taxpayers may face a fine, jail sentence or, a combination of the two.</p>

        <p>Prosecutions fall under federal jurisdiction, and are instituted in accordance with the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-3.3/">Income Tax Act</a>.</p>
