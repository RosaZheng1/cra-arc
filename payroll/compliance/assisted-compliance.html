 <div class="row">
 <div class="col-md-8">

<p>The payroll assisted compliance review (PACR) is a program that offers you support as a businesses or a self-employed worker to help you (as an employer) understand your payroll deducting, withholding, remitting, and reporting obligations and how to meet them. </p>

<p>This is not a full examination or an audit. The PACR process is less invasive and focuses on specific payroll issues, providing you with an opportunity to voluntarily correct errors before facing penalties.</p>

<h2 id="toc1">Benefits of the PACR</h2>
<p>You may be invited by the CRA to participate, but you can also request a review voluntarily. The goal is to assist you  in complying with payroll laws without a formal audit.</p>

<p>The PACR focuses on key payroll aspects such as correct payroll deductions (income tax, CPP, EI), accurate reporting on employee benefits, and proper T4 slip issuance. It ensures you are correctly remitting payroll taxes.</p>
<p>The CRA works with you to identify payroll discrepancies and provides feedback to help correct any issues. It is a cooperative process aimed at compliance improvement.</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> This is your opportunity for correction, it may help you avoid costly penalties by catching issues early. For example, if errors are identified, you are given the chance to correct them without facing significant penalties or interest charges. This could include adjusting payroll records or filing corrected slips.</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> The CRA will provide education and resources for best practices in payroll administration. The CRA may provide recommendations to help you maintain compliance in the future.</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> The PACR fosters a cooperative relationship with the CRA, rather than a confrontational one that might occur during a full examination review.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a PACR is a proactive, collaborative process aimed at helping you maintain accurate payroll reporting and remittance practices, reducing the chances of future issues or audits.</p>


<h2 id="toc2">Process of the PACR</h2>
 <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr stps-strpd">

<li><details open><summary><span class="h3">Your account is selected for a PARC</span></summary> 
<p id="step1">The CRA will send you an initial contact letter to inform you (as the employer) that your payroll account has been selected for a PARC. If you receive a letter, it is important that you read the details and follow the instructions. </p>
<p>The letter outlines the purpose of the review, the areas of payroll compliance that will be examined, and may also include a request for necessary documents or information.</p>
<p>A CRA officer will call you within approximately 2 weeks after sending the letter to discuss the process of this PARC. Before the review,  the officer will determine if your business qualifies for the payroll assisted compliance review service. </p>

<p>The CRA encourages you to gather the requested documents to make sure you have them available when the CRA officer calls. You may also want to be prepared with questions you have that are related to the issues mentioned in the letter because the officer may be available to answer them. You can also reach the CRA officer directly, in advance of their call, using the contact information in the letter.</p>

<p>Generally, most of the PACR are completed remotely. The CRA may request an in-person or virtual meeting to discuss your payroll processes, review the documents, and provide guidance on any necessary corrections.</p>

<p>The review is designed to be a cooperative effort to help you meet your payroll obligations.</p>

</details></li>

<li><details><summary><span class="h3">Phone call and the CRA requests payroll documents</span></summary> 
<p>Following the initial letter, the CRA may also call you to discuss the details of the review, answer any questions, and explain the process. This call helps clarify the scope of the review and may also be used to schedule any required meetings.</p>
<p>The CRA officer may request specific payroll documents.  Generally, you are given a reasonable time frame to gather and submit the requested information, which can be sent electronically or by mail. The following are examples of documents you may need to provide: </p>

</details></li>
<li><details><summary><span class="h3">How to prepare for the review</span></summary>
<p>The CRA’s risk-assessment systems identify accounts that are considered to be at high risk for non-compliance. When an account is identified as high-risk, a CRA officer will review information from various sources to determine whether an examination or account review is needed to address the risks identified. For example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>You made an error in calculating deductions or you did not withhold deductions <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/calculating-deductions/making-deductions.html">Get ready to make deductions</a></li>
    <li>Determined that they have taxes owing.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc2">If your information return was prepared or filed by a tax preparer</h3>
<p>Even if a professional tax preparer may have completed your payrol information returns (for example, T4 slips and T4 summary) on your behalf, you are responsible for making sure your business meets all their payroll tax obligations. Generally, tax preparers will use the information you give them to prepare your remittance amounts and information returns, but they may not be aware of all your tax obligations. This is why the CRA may contact you directly for the review.</p>

<h3>What if errors are identified but you do not correct them</h3>
<p>If you choose not to file or make the remittance payments to correct any errors identified by the CRA officer during this PACR, it will be noted in your account.  The CRA may issue an assessment and may take future enforcement actions.</p>
