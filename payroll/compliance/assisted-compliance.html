            <h2><a id="toc0"></a>What is the Assisted Compliance program and how does it work?<br/></h2>
<p>The Assisted Compliance program offers support to businesses and self-employed individuals by helping them understand their tax obligations and how to meet them. </p>
<p>Officers, who are subject matter experts, will contact taxpayers to explain potential tax issues identified in their accounts and help them correct any mistakes. </p>
<p>The Assisted Compliance program addresses single issues and covers a variety of topics such as how to properly report a property disposition, repairs and maintenance expenses on rental properties, T5018 statement of contract payments, and other topics. </p>
<p>Officers will:</p>
<ul>
<li>send a personalized letter outlining the potential tax issue;</li>
<li>follow up by telephone about two weeks later to give tailored information to the taxpayer to help them better understand their tax obligations; and</li>
<li>provide information on the steps to self-correct the tax issue.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="toc1"></a>What to do if you receive a letter<br/></h2>
<p>If you receive a letter, it is important that you read the details and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>A CRA officer will call you within approximately two weeks after sending the letter to discuss its contents.</p>
<p>We encourage you to gather the requested documents in order for you to have them available when the officer calls. In addition, you may want to be prepared with questions you have that are related to the issues mentioned in the letter as the officer will be available to answer them. You can also reach the CRA officer directly, in advance of their call, using the contact information in the letter.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that you are not under audit. The officer will ask you to review your tax returns and make sure any potential tax issues are reported correctly. If you find errors, you can correct your returns by <a href="#toc3">requesting an adjustment</a>. The officer will also be available to help you complete this request.</p>
<h3>What if errors are identified, but not corrected?</h3>
<p>If you choose not to request an adjustment to correct any errors identified in your tax information, it will be noted in your account and may lead to future enforcement action.</p>
<h2><a id="toc2"></a>If your tax return was prepared or filed by a tax preparer</h2>
<p>Although a professional tax preparer may have completed your tax returns, you are responsible for making sure you meet all your tax obligations. Generally, tax preparers will use the information you give them to prepare your tax returns and may not be aware of all your tax obligations. This is why the CRA has sent this letter directly to you.</p>
<h2><a id="toc3"></a>Requesting an adjustment<br/></h2>
<p>If you would like us to change one or more of your tax returns, you have to submit a request for an adjustment.</p>
<p>You can request changes to your previously filed tax returns using <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1-adj.html">T1 Adjustment Request</a>. For information on changing corporate returns, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/after-you-file-your-corporation-income-tax-return/reassessments-adjustments-your-t2-return/requesting-a-reassessment-your-t2-return.html" style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255);">Requesting a reassessment of your T2 return</a>. The assigned CRA officer can help you complete this request.</p>
<p>Adjustments to your tax returns allow you to change any amounts you claimed or income you reported on any line of your tax return or schedules. Please note that changes may result in either a refund or an amount owing.</p>

<h1>Payroll Assisted Compliance Review (PACR) in Canada</h1>
<p>A Payroll Assisted Compliance Review (PACR) is a program conducted by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to help businesses ensure they are meeting their payroll-related tax obligations. Unlike a full audit, a PACR is less invasive and focuses on specific payroll issues, providing businesses with an opportunity to voluntarily correct errors before facing penalties.</p>
<h2>Key Features of a PACR</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Voluntary Participation</h3>
<p>Businesses are often invited by the CRA to participate, but they can also request a review voluntarily. The goal is to assist businesses in complying with payroll laws without a formal audit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>The PACR focuses on key payroll aspects such as correct payroll deductions (income tax, CPP, EI), accurate reporting on employee benefits, and proper T4 slip issuance. It ensures businesses are properly remitting payroll taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Collaborative Process</h3>
<p>The CRA works with the business to identify payroll discrepancies and provides feedback to help correct any issues. It is a cooperative process aimed at compliance improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>How CRA contact you for a Payroll Assisted Compliance Review (PACR)</h3>
<p>If an employer is selected for a Payroll Assisted Compliance Review (PACR), the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) typically contacts them through the following methods:</p>
<h4>1. Notification Letter</h4>
<p>The CRA usually sends a formal letter notifying the employer that they have been selected for a PACR. The letter outlines the purpose of the review, the areas of payroll compliance that will be examined, and a request for necessary documents or information.</p>
<h4>2. Phone Call</h4>
<p>The CRA may follow up the letter with a phone call to discuss the details of the review, answer any questions, and explain the process. This call helps clarify the scope of the review and may also be used to schedule any required meetings.</p>
<h4>3. Request for Documentation</h4>
<p>The CRA may request specific documents, such as payroll records, employee tax slips (T4s), and remittance forms. Employers are generally given a reasonable time frame to gather and submit the requested information, which can be sent electronically or by mail.</p>
<h4>4. In-Person or Virtual Meeting</h4>
<p>While many PACRs are conducted remotely, the CRA may request an in-person or virtual meeting to discuss the employer’s payroll processes, review the documents, and provide guidance on any necessary corrections.</p>
<h4>5. Follow-Up Communication</h4>
<p>After the initial review of documents, the CRA may reach out for further clarifications or additional documentation. Follow-up communication can be done via phone or email, depending on the complexity of the case.</p>
<p>Employers are advised to respond promptly to all communications from the CRA and provide accurate and complete information to ensure a smooth and efficient PACR process. The review is designed to be a cooperative effort to help employers meet their payroll compliance obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Less Formal than an Audit</h3>
<p>A PACR is less intrusive than a full audit and focuses on helping businesses improve payroll systems without the pressure of a formal audit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Opportunity for Correction</h3>
<p>If errors are identified, businesses are given the chance to correct them without facing significant penalties or interest charges. This could include adjusting payroll records or filing corrected T4 slips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Education and Support</h3>
<p>The PACR process includes education and resources for best practices in payroll administration. The CRA may provide recommendations to help businesses maintain compliance in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits of a PACR</h2>
<ul>
<li>Helps businesses avoid costly penalties by catching issues early.</li>
<li>Provides guidance and education on payroll compliance.</li>
<li>Fosters a cooperative relationship with the CRA, rather than a confrontational one that might occur during a full audit.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a Payroll Assisted Compliance Review is a proactive, collaborative process aimed at helping businesses maintain accurate payroll reporting and remittance practices, reducing the likelihood of future issues or audits.</p>
