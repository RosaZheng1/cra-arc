 <div class="row">
 <div class="col-md-6">

<p>The payroll assisted compliance review (PACR) is a program that offers you support as a businesses or a self-employed worker to help you (as an employer) understand your payroll-related tax obligations and how to meet them. </p>

<p>This is not a full examination or an audit. The PACR process is less invasive and focuses on specific payroll issues, providing you with an opportunity to voluntarily correct errors before facing penalties.</p>

<h3>Key features of the PACR</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Voluntary participation</h4>
<p>You may be invited by the CRA to participate, but you can also request a review voluntarily. The goal is to assist you  in complying with payroll laws without a formal audit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>The PACR focuses on key payroll aspects such as correct payroll deductions (income tax, CPP, EI), accurate reporting on employee benefits, and proper T4 slip issuance. It ensures you are correctly remitting payroll taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Collaborative process</h4>
<p>The CRA works with you to identify payroll discrepancies and provides feedback to help correct any issues. It is a cooperative process aimed at compliance improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>How CRA contact you for a PACR</h4>
<p>If you are selected for PACR, the CRA will generally contact you using one of the following methods:</p>
<h4>Notification letter</h4>
<p>Generally, the CRA sends a formal letter notifying you that you have been selected for a PACR. If you receive a letter, it is important that you read the details and follow the instructions. </p>
<p>The letter outlines the purpose of the review, the areas of payroll compliance that will be examined, and may also include a request for necessary documents or information.</p>
<p>A CRA officer will call you within approximately 2 weeks after sending the letter to discuss the process of this PARC.</p>

<p>The CRA encourages you to gather the requested documents to make sure you have them available when the CRA officer calls. You may also want to be prepared with questions you have that are related to the issues mentioned in the letter because the officer may be available to answer them. You can also reach the CRA officer directly, in advance of their call, using the contact information in the letter.</p>

<h4>Phone call</h4>
<p>Following the initial letter, the CRA may also call you to discuss the details of the review, answer any questions, and explain the process. This call helps clarify the scope of the review and may also be used to schedule any required meetings.</p>
<h4>Request for documents</h4>
<p>The CRA may request specific documents, such as payroll records, employee tax slips (T4s), and remittance forms. Generally, you are given a reasonable time frame to gather and submit the requested information, which can be sent electronically or by mail.</p>
<h4>In-person or virtual meeting</h4>
<p>Generally, most of the PACR are completed remotely. The CRA may request an in-person or virtual meeting to discuss your payroll processes, review the documents, and provide guidance on any necessary corrections.</p>
<h4>Follow-up communication</h4>
<p>After the initial review of documents, the CRA may reach out for further clarifications or additional documentation. Follow-up communication can be done via phone or email, depending on the complexity of the case.</p>
<p>You are advised to respond promptly to all communications from the CRA and provide accurate and complete information to ensure a smooth and efficient PACR process. </p>

<p>The review is designed to be a cooperative effort to help you meet your payroll obligations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits of the PACR</h2>

<ul>
<li>This is your opportunity for correction, it may help you avoid costly penalties by catching issues early. For example, if errors are identified, you are given the chance to correct them without facing significant penalties or interest charges. This could include adjusting payroll records or filing corrected slips.</li>
<li>The CRA will provide education and resources for best practices in payroll administration. The CRA may provide recommendations to help you maintain compliance in the future.</li>
<li>The PACR fosters a cooperative relationship with the CRA, rather than a confrontational one that might occur during a full examination review.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a PACR is a proactive, collaborative process aimed at helping you maintain accurate payroll reporting and remittance practices, reducing the chances of future issues or audits.</p>



<h2><a id="toc1"></a>What to do if you receive a letter<br/></h2>

<p>It’s important to note that you are not under audit. The officer will ask you to review your tax returns and make sure any potential tax issues are reported correctly. If you find errors, you can correct your returns by <a href="#toc3">requesting an adjustment</a>. The officer will also be available to help you complete this request.</p>
<h3>What if errors are identified, but not corrected?</h3>
<p>If you choose not to request an adjustment to correct any errors identified in your tax information, it will be noted in your account and may lead to future enforcement action.</p>
<h2><a id="toc2"></a>If your tax return was prepared or filed by a tax preparer</h2>
<p>Although a professional tax preparer may have completed your tax returns, you are responsible for making sure you meet all your tax obligations. Generally, tax preparers will use the information you give them to prepare your tax returns and may not be aware of all your tax obligations. This is why the CRA has sent this letter directly to you.</p>
<h2><a id="toc3"></a>Requesting an adjustment<br/></h2>
<p>If you would like us to change one or more of your tax returns, you have to submit a request for an adjustment.</p>
<p>You can request changes to your previously filed tax returns using <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1-adj.html">T1 Adjustment Request</a>. For information on changing corporate returns, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/after-you-file-your-corporation-income-tax-return/reassessments-adjustments-your-t2-return/requesting-a-reassessment-your-t2-return.html" style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255);">Requesting a reassessment of your T2 return</a>. The assigned CRA officer can help you complete this request.</p>
<p>Adjustments to your tax returns allow you to change any amounts you claimed or income you reported on any line of your tax return or schedules. Please note that changes may result in either a refund or an amount owing.</p>
