            <h2><a id="toc0"></a>What is the Assisted Compliance program and how does it work?<br/></h2>
<p>The Assisted Compliance program offers support to businesses and self-employed individuals by helping them understand their tax obligations and how to meet them. </p>
<p>Officers, who are subject matter experts, will contact taxpayers to explain potential tax issues identified in their accounts and help them correct any mistakes. </p>
<p>The Assisted Compliance program addresses single issues and covers a variety of topics such as how to properly report a property disposition, repairs and maintenance expenses on rental properties, T5018 statement of contract payments, and other topics. </p>
<p>Officers will:</p>
<ul>
<li>send a personalized letter outlining the potential tax issue;</li>
<li>follow up by telephone about two weeks later to give tailored information to the taxpayer to help them better understand their tax obligations; and</li>
<li>provide information on the steps to self-correct the tax issue.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="toc1"></a>What to do if you receive a letter<br/></h2>
<p>If you receive a letter, it is important that you read the details and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>A CRA officer will call you within approximately two weeks after sending the letter to discuss its contents.</p>
<p>We encourage you to gather the requested documents in order for you to have them available when the officer calls. In addition, you may want to be prepared with questions you have that are related to the issues mentioned in the letter as the officer will be available to answer them. You can also reach the CRA officer directly, in advance of their call, using the contact information in the letter.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that you are not under audit. The officer will ask you to review your tax returns and make sure any potential tax issues are reported correctly. If you find errors, you can correct your returns by <a href="#toc3">requesting an adjustment</a>. The officer will also be available to help you complete this request.</p>
<h3>What if errors are identified, but not corrected?</h3>
<p>If you choose not to request an adjustment to correct any errors identified in your tax information, it will be noted in your account and may lead to future enforcement action.</p>
<h2><a id="toc2"></a>If your tax return was prepared or filed by a tax preparer</h2>
<p>Although a professional tax preparer may have completed your tax returns, you are responsible for making sure you meet all your tax obligations. Generally, tax preparers will use the information you give them to prepare your tax returns and may not be aware of all your tax obligations. This is why the CRA has sent this letter directly to you.</p>
<h2><a id="toc3"></a>Requesting an adjustment<br/></h2>
<p>If you would like us to change one or more of your tax returns, you have to submit a request for an adjustment.</p>
<p>You can request changes to your previously filed tax returns using <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1-adj.html">T1 Adjustment Request</a>. For information on changing corporate returns, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/after-you-file-your-corporation-income-tax-return/reassessments-adjustments-your-t2-return/requesting-a-reassessment-your-t2-return.html" style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255);">Requesting a reassessment of your T2 return</a>. The assigned CRA officer can help you complete this request.</p>
<p>Adjustments to your tax returns allow you to change any amounts you claimed or income you reported on any line of your tax return or schedules. Please note that changes may result in either a refund or an amount owing.</p>
